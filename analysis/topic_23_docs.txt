 right way. I think I am justified in feeling this way based on the fact that there haven't really been anything requiring that they 
 would disaggregate the data- just that they will start looking at race. Ivy league style affirmative action still creates a class of 
 elites, albeit a more diverse one only in skin color. \n\nI just don't think the white man has our best interests at hand to actually 
 make an effective system without being mandated to. Will they actually take all the subtle nuances into account, subgroups of race, 
 generation, income, jobs of parents, family history, ESL, etc. and actually use them to create a more equitable system, or will they 
 claim they are but just treat this as picking colors from the home depot paint store? They have every incentive to pick the latter, 
 and if so, then we'd stand more to benefit from the system of economic affirmative action. I can't support the measure as of now

                 selective force for asian immigrants who put less value on social skills and more on academic/employable skills.

 '> I believe your UC system like every other social institution is a limited resource. Taxpayer dollars are also a limited resource. Everyone wants more funding.\n\nThis what I believe as well, and this is why I believe that college admissions is ultimately zero-sum.  There\'s a limited amount of professors, teaching assistants, money, hours, apartments, you-name-it.  Those that say it is positive-sum are only correct in a limited frame of reference.  \n\nI also believe the ones that are most adversely affected by affirmative action are the "poor" Asians, the ones that ironically enough are most likely to support affirmative action.  Here\'s why:  All things being equal, a university is more likely to choose the applicant that can pay their way, rather than the one that needs financial assistance.  Asian admissions as a whole will almost certainly decline (in the name of "diversity"), and the ones left in the cold will be the ones that somehow believe they will be beneficiaries of the system. \n\nYou can only have social justice if there was social injustice in the first place.  And I have hard time believing that a meritocratic system is unjust.  I also have just as hard of a time understanding why the qualified Asian student should give up his seat to a non-Asian in the name of diversity.  If there are Asians that are supportive of this sort of social engineering, they should voluntarily give up their own seats, rather than support a system that mandates that fellow Asians do so and is also likely to be *more* unjust than its predecessor. \n\nI actually think one of the most interesting cases regarding affirmative action is [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-clarence-thomas-grew-to-hate-affirmative-action-2013-10) one regarding Clarence Thomas.  If any of you have read Clarence Thomas\'s opinions, well... let\'s just say I think I need to limit my jackass maneuvers on this sub before I get banned again. :)',

 'This fails to consider the hardships faced by students prior to their application though. A student complaining about a poor black student taking their place fails to consider the disproportionate disadvantages that student faced long before high school. They did not have the same opportunities for higher education, they did not have the same opportunities with respect to community support, and they did not get to enjoy all the amenities that come with economic status. The only advantages considered here appear to be those that Affirmative Action can influence, but doesn\'t consider any other social advantages that exist.\n\nIf you want an argument against Affirmative Action, a better appeal would be to using a combined socio-economic metric as a replacement rather than arguing that "merit alone" should be the sole deciding factor. The current system will favor wealthy blacks over those from poorer backgrounds, and poor Asian immigrants such as the Hmong will be put at an unintended disadvantage.\n\nStill, I\'ve seen many argue that Affirmative Action doesn\'t even play any significant role in the admissions process, so, failed or not, it doesn\'t seem like it really ought to be blamed for not getting into your preferred school.']
