But let's do a little thought experiment. Suppose our country decides to provide social services or perhaps even reparations specifically for URM or African descendents of slaves. Like many other government services, this would be funded by a 1% income tax on the general population. Would you support that? 

Now suppose that tax is 2% for Asians only, but still 1% for whites, would you still support it? The social services or reparations will surely help those in need. But do you think it's fair to levy a greater tax on Asian Americans to solve a problem created by white society? This scenario is pretty analogous to how AA works right now. A 1% tax across the board is much easier to justify, whereas specifically taxing Asians at a higher rate than whites is outlandish.

There really is no defensible reason for Asians to be discriminated more than white applicants in college admissions, which points to this aspect to be more of a feature than a bug. The fact of the matter is, whites gain the most from AA. They get to reap the benefits of a diverse student body, yes, but more importantly, they are able maintain their plurality in the composition of the student body. 

Unfortunately for Asians, they have almost no political power in this country. This leads the community to partner up and file lawsuits alongside white conservatives who are so racist they don't even know that AA is actually good for whites. The whole issue around AA is framed as an Asians vs black issue but in reality it's the elite whites that are laughing to the bank. 

Lawsuits are most visible at the top institutions but if you see the trends these days it has gotten extremely hard for Asians to get into college. You can easily find Asian kids who are some of the top students at their high school getting wait-listed at very average instate public universities. Couple that with the explosion of Asian immigration the past few decades due to the prolific H1B visa, it will only more and more competitive because every Asian kid knows that they aren't competing with white kids, they only competing against other Asian kids for the limited number of available spots.",t5_3amv4

To use the workplace promotion example: yea, we might feel resentment when we see a black guy be fast tracked, but lets say he wasn't promoted- it's not like an asian would have gotten that role. In all likelihood a white guy would have gotten it instead. A win for blacks is a loss for whites is a win for asians. That's how we should look at it (the caveat is affirmation action, where it's clearly a loss for asians but that's a separate topic. I myself don't support affirmative action).

How can you say this when you contradict yourself in the same paragraph. You say a win for blacks is not a loss for Asians, then bring up affirmative action which is a win for blacks and a loss for Asians.

There is absolutely no evidence showing that once the black community has a seat at the table, that they will save a seat for Asians. In fact, blacks and white groups achieving equality makes it more likely that those on the outside (nonblack and non-white) get marginalized. For a brief period of time, it actually appeared that black and white Americans were somewhat united against a common enemy in China because of covid19, and they both took out frustrations against the Asian community. That is, until George Floyd was murdered.

Standing up for police brutality is noble and the right thing to do since no one deserves to get murdered based on the color of their skin.

It's hard to argue that Asian Americans will definitively be better off under Republican tax plans. There are plenty of Asians in America living in poor conditions, and there are very few Asian Americans running big businesses or have large investment portfolios that benefit the most under Republican tax plans.

egyfnwe,t1_egx8xyr,Stoxastic,1550760837.0,,"Despite what people think, colleges are not trying to give admissions to ""people who deserve it the most.""
 
Most universities believe (rightly or wrongly, this is up for debate), that a RACIALLY diverse student body enhances the college experience for all students. They may be trying to help struggling minorities move up the social ladder as well but that's not the primary reason. The primary reason is that they believe students have a better college experience with racial diversity. Harvard letting in a few black kids is a drop in the ocean of solving racial injustice. However, those black kids may have a larger effect on positively shaping the experiences of the student body.

Knowing this, we see that an economic based affirmative action, while appearing to be more deserving for applicants, doesn't give the student body racial diversity that the school desires.

That being said, this also goes the other way, as Harvard believes that a student body of >20% Asian is too much. Of course more Asians are deserving of admission, but Harvard doesn't care about who deserves it. They care about student body diversity. This is, however, the definition of a quota. Quotas were ruled illegal in a previous supreme court decision. Harvard went around it by attributing a bullshit personality score to Asians. And this is why they went to court. 

Affirmative action is definitely a form of discrimination however despite that there is probably some merit behind having a racially diverse student body. If Harvard came out and said ""yeah we just don't want more that >20% Asian, nothing personal, sorry"" then it would still be bullshit but at least there isn't some bullshit narrative that our personalities are shit. But they can't say that because it's  illegal. Right now Harvard is discriminating against us and gaslighting us in court that it's our fault for getting denied admissions.

Personally I think that supreme court decision is absolute bullshit (schools can use race in admissions but can't have quota). They need to overturn it, and either give schools the full ability to do race based admissions and institute quotas, or to remove race based admissions altogether.

Underrepresented minorities get help in college admissions because they are extremely marginalized in order areas of society.

When the UC system got rid of affirmative action, the number of Asian American students attending skyrocketed to 40% and the number of black students declined. Because of space limitations, it is mostly a zero sum game. By instituting AA they absolutely are pushing people out of different ethnicities who have higher qualifications. Black enrollment at Harvard would go from 12% to 7% with no AA and Asian American enrollment would go up from 20% to above 30%.

**Asians and Whites Are Required to Have Significantly Better Qualifications than Black Applicants to Gain Admission**: Before the Harvard Affirm. Action case trial in 2018, we didn't know the actual data on how AA plays out in schools. Now we do. To get a recruitment letter to an elite school like Harvard an Asian American 17-year-old child (who bears no responsibility for slavery or racist laws) needed to score roughly 250 points higher on her SAT than a black child. That is larger than a standard deviation for the SAT. It's a major difference.  A white child (who also bears no responsibility for slavery or racist laws) needed to score roughly 150 points higher than a black student. That's also a significant difference.

Everyone retreats here to discussing ""disadvantages"" that AA is meant to correct. But that's not how its applied at elite schools. The threshold scores required for Asian students (and whites) is almost entirely based on their skin color, not their family's income. The SFFA have demanded that Harvard institute a socio-economic action plan to help lower-income students that is  race neutral. Harvard has refused.  The advantage a black applicant receives is irrespective of  whether her parents are from Nigeria, the Caribbean, Detroit, or has two lawyer parents named Barack and Michelle. The schools are focused on skin color, however they can get it, because its quantifiable and shows up on their stat-sheets.

In this context, racial equity is the unequal distribution of resources (which could include school admissions, money, favorable news reporting, or even laws and their enforcement) to groups based upon racial background in order to correct for historical and ongoing injustice and in equality that existed or exists between those races. (That's the most charitable and ""steel-man"" description I can give).

Affirmative Action is a classic example of racial equity: make it easier for black students to get into selective colleges at the expense of other racial groups (Asian, White, even Hispanic) that are deemed by the school to be less disadvantaged by their skin color (technically this is not the official legal justification for Affirm. Action you'll see in legal briefs because it was rejected, but its the justification that was originally intended by the schools that came up with the policy).

Reporting on white shooters with gusto and ignoring or downplaying stories of Black homicides is another example of equity. The thought process might be: ""Black Americans have enough issues on their plate and their crime rates are attributable to circumstances placed on them by Whites and White-controlled policies, therefore we shouldn't highlight their murders and murder statistics."" A third example is that only when the police kill an unarmed black man does it become national news--even though the majority of unarmed people killed by police are white.

Since the last two examples are done consciously as a way to control the narrative or protect one group at the expense of another for a greater goal, I would categorize it as a racial equity policy. There's another word for this: propaganda, or information wars.

Sexual degradation of Asian women? It boils down to seeing Asian women as interchangeable. Asian women are objectified because the empathy (and ultimately, guilt) which would come from an XF who gyyresembles family/friends is not a factor. Asian women are a blank canvas to these men to which they apply their depravity of choice (submissive, or dragon lady, whatever floats their boat). The sexual castration of Asian men is the flip side of the same coin- it's just second nature to think of Asians as a horde with singular characteristics.  And it's the same with the acts of violence around Stop Asian Hate-  I don't need to explain the connection between lack of empathy for Asians, and the violent attacks against our elderly (even the most Racist white supremacist wouldn't for example, attack an elderly Black person- some lines you just don't cross. Except when it comes to Asians, where there is no line).  Getting the short end of the stick in affirmative action? It's ok, they're just Asians.

So what can we do about it? How can we everyday people raise the status of Asian people in the social consciousness? I can think of two ways

&#x200B;

1.	Start sharing memes, tik toks, and tweets from Asian creators featuring Asian people.  You’ll notice that this is the soft tactic that White and Asian people recently have been using to uplift the Black community.  Some ppl I know go as far as using Black skinned emojis, when they are themselves Asian.  Memes and social content go viral because ppl can relate to the message, and/or find it funny.   When you relate to the message, you relate to the person. And these people then share the content to others- there’s no easier way to inject empathy and realness to thousands maybe even millions.  This is a quick and easy way to put Asians on the social table and into people’s consciousness.

&#x200B;

1.	Whenever you write anything, be sure to capitalize the A in Asian. I know it seems silly,  but there is much more stronger visual (and therefore mental impact with) ""Asian"" versus ""asian.""  ""Asian"" commands respect, and denotes an identity worth paying attention to. ""asian"" comes off as meek and subservient, not worth highlighting.  Don't be afraid to demand notice. Make people get used to noticing Asians.",t5_3amv4
gvyujk,,owlficus,1591207095.0,Activist :fist-emoji:,"Why the asian community should be supporting the black community now I'm going to start this  controversially by laying out the reasons, in the spirit of open dialogue,  why I know some of us are hesitant to throw in our support-

1. Some of us who grew up with a large black population know that the day-to-day altercations between  our communities are overwhelmingly when blacks target asians (robberies, assaults,  harrassment), as opposed to the other way around.  Both in terms of frequency and severity. From this we feel resentment.
2. We are acutely aware that the black community as a whole have never thrown in their support for the asian community (except for a few enlightened individuals - and for that we thank you - you are punching wayyyy above your weight and are often the ones dropping the mic the hardest). Even when the black community has much more of a capacity to do so, than the other way around. From this we feel resentment
3. We see in our workplace black people getting special treatment (promotions, etc) and this is in juxtaposition with asians getting the bamboo ceiling. From this we feel resentment.
4. We see affirmative action in education as something that directly reduces our percentages, even more so than it impacts whites. From this we feel resentment.
5. We see the crime statistics where yes, blacks commit either the most in absolute numbers, or disproportionately high nbrs per their population. From this we feel apathy.
6. Many of us grew up just as poor, and even in the same communities. With the added limitation of not being able to speak english. From this we feel apathy.

And yet despite all these issues, here is why we should throw in our support (aside from decency and compassion): We have a common enemy. As the adage goes- ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."" White supremacy is the plague we need to eradicate, and black issues have always been the biggest accelerant to its eradication.  We might be bitter that black issues get the national stage (while asian issues do not) but that doesn't change the fact that they are best tool we have to take down white supremacy. If we wait till asian issues reach the same amount of exposure until we join the fight (and who knows if that will ever happen), we might not - to use a video game term - be able to deliver that critical hit. And that is why we need to join the fight now.   Also, with regards to resentment, a win for blacks is not a loss for asians. It's not like we are next in line for any equality actions. To use the workplace promotion example: yea, we might feel resentment when we see a black guy be fast tracked, but lets say he wasn't promoted- it's not like an asian would have gotten that role. In all likelihood a white guy would have gotten it instead.  A win for blacks is a loss for whites is a win for asians. That's how we should look at it (the caveat is affirmation action, where it's clearly a loss for asians but that's a separate topic. I myself don't support affirmative action).

So we should join the fight with blacks, but we should do it properly. We should not be throwing ourselves under the bus like the boba americans have been doing with their vilification of Thao and saying that he's proof asians need also to work on our anti-blackness (Thao is a weak link on that front anyway as just an excuse we're using to cannibalize ourselves). That conversation needs to be had later, not now while we need to deliver that critical hit against our common adversary. Anything short of that focus is a distraction and a splintering of our resources (having blacks and asians turn their heads toward the asian community means less energy spent on the bigger issue- eg those bobas could and should  be writing articles on white supremacy instead). You show solidarity by snowballing the current issue, not by cannibalizing ourselves- because that makes us our own enemy, and as adage goes, a friend to white supremacy.",t5_3amv4

fetishization of AM is acceptable (not excusable, just acceptable) at this very nascent moment because:

1.	AMs haven’t reached the point where they are socially privileged (unlike WMs)

2.	The fetish for AMs comes from a place of respect (of the AM, the asian culture as a whole, and of asian females as well). It may be hyper and misguided respect, but it’s respect nonetheless. Contrast this with WMs who have yellow fever, where the fetish comes from a place of degradation, disrespect,  and sexual stereotypes (of the AF, of the asian culture, and of AMs)

Quick example: these women wouldn’t think of asian food as weird/inferior. 

3.	there isn’t a massive power structure  which perpetuates and amplifies the AM fetish, unlike the WMAF industrial complex.In fact, the women who have a thing for AMs somehow managed to have it despite the actively negative industrial complex against AMs
4.	 Unlike the WMs, there isn’t this phenomena of the women going for AMs because they’re otherwise  rejects

1. The first thing many schools have already done is going test-optional. I predict that this will have noticeable effects on graduation rates and average outcomes at the schools that continue to do this. We might even see graduation rates below 90% at grade-inflation happy Ivy League schools.
2. Harvard (and perhaps other schools) has been noticeably increasing the number of Asian students admitted since 2018. Almost all of this increase has been at the expense of white students. Now that affirmative action is gone, the artificial suppression of white applicants will end and the university will use this data to try to claim that ending affirmative action hurts minorities.
3. Legacy programs, at least those as widespread and public as they are today, will mostly end. Universities will claim that they are doing this to combat the racist Supreme Court decision, although of course they could have done this all along.
4. Students of all races who have suffered actual disadvantage will see improvements in their admissions results as race-neutral criteria are adopted. From the perspective of life experiences, schools will be more diverse.
5. Universities will never admit that they did anything wrong or apologize. Yet the perception of the public and the media will start to shift (this may take longer, a decade or so).
6. Asian students will no longer be denied a fair opportunity for their education.

What do you guys think will happen? It will be interesting to check in after some time to see how accurate these predictions are.",t5_247ao9

EDIT:
SFFA v. Harvard: 6-2
SFFA v. UNC 6-3
Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson dissenting.

The opinion of the court was pretty nice. It completely shut down UNC's claim that SFFA had no standing because it wasn't made up of members who experienced any harm. That's just insane to me (as an SFFA member who certainly experienced harm in the admissions process). It went on to explain that even the past Supreme Court decisions that supported affirmative action were not full-throated endorsements; they understood that there must be limits in magnitude and time, yet the universities did not seriously consider any of these boundaries. The notion of diversity they pushed to justify their programs were not really measurable and subject to judicial review. The opinion did allow for colleges to consider race in so far as a student wrote an essay about overcoming it, because this was about the student's individual character instead of just a blanket preference for certain racial groups. I'm actually OK with this, as long as an Asian student writing about experiencing racism is taken the same as a student of another race (it's well-known that this hasn't been the case; Asian students have been actively discouraged from writing about racism/immigration in particular).

One place I felt that the main opinion fell short was that it didn't acknowledge that the universities are participating in a mass intentional discrimination against Asians. Gorsuch teased this line of argument from SFFA but fell short of endorsing it; he said in a concurring opinion that EVEN IF that were not true, the use of race by universities still doesn't hold up to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

Sotomayor had, as she often does, a ridiculous opinion full of half-truths and bias. She apparently felt the need to read sections of this opinion from the bench. It was all about how programs for freedmen after emancipation were ""race-conscious"" and Justice Harlan's dissent where he said ""Our Constitution is color-blind"" was really an endorsement for race-consciousness. She placed her opinion firmly in opposition to Justice Thomas's, where she said a review article he cited on ""mismatch theory"" actually disproved it (mismatch is the theory that even the supposed beneficiaries of affirmative action are actually harmed because they are not academically competitive in the schools they are accepted to). She quoted from the article: “economists should be very skeptical of the mismatch hypothesis”. I was actually very confused by this so I read the article here: https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Loury/louryhomepage/teaching/Affirmative_Action/Meeting_V/supporting_documents/Arcidiacono-Lovenheim_Quality-Fit_Tradeoff%20(JEL%202016).pdf

It's more clear when you read the whole sentence: ""At first blush, economists should be very skeptical of the mismatch hypothesis."" The paragraph goes on to clarify: this is because economists would assume students to act rationally in their own best interests, but mismatch happens when schools have more information about fit than students do, but accept ill-fitting students for diversity reasons.

I'm not too surprised. This phony justice continually mixed up words during oral arguments, couldn't keep straight the difference between ""de jure"" and ""de facto"", and kept on saying ""matrix"" instead of ""metrics"" in an attempt to sound smart. One of the best outcomes of the end of the affirmative action regime will be to keep such patently unqualified people out of the institutions that are important for our nation.",t5_247ao9

I didn't get to see the negative reaction thread which was apparently deleted, but I'd like to post my own view.

I'm an alumnus and I also worked at the university for a little while. Back in 2014, Gene Block sent a letter to the UCLA community to support SCA-5, a bill to allow affirmative action which was ultimately unsuccessful due to opposition from Asian members of the CA legislature. To me, he's expressed a clear political position, so there is some context for the recent letter.

Now I agree that having resources for Hispanic/Latino students when they arrive at UCLA is a good thing, as well as stronger recruitment efforts for local high schools and community colleges. That's the right way to go about it, compared to racial preferences. But a ""goal"" to achieve 25% of a certain race, who have a plurality no less, definitely irks me. It's comparable to saying that we must retain 25% whites (who are actually underrepresented at UCLA compared to their share of the CA population), and I imagine that this would offend many people.

Well, you might say, there's a history there where whites are privileged and Latinos are underprivileged. However, there's also a history of discrimination against Asians as well, especially in our state: the Chinese Exclusion Act or Japanese internment camps, for example. When I was at UCLA, I heard disparaging remarks about the number of Asians in the university from faculty and administrators. And UCLA has a history of discriminating against Asians, being found guilty in a federal investigation of discriminating against Asian-Americans in graduate admissions, with the penalty of being forced to admit those students.

I'm going to respond to Chancellor Block's email to tell him what I think. He was always very open to input from students (even holding regular office hours), I suggest that if you have strong feelings about this then you can do the same.",t5_2qscu

I read about your comments after last Wednesday’s session of the California Assembly on ACA 5. I was really impressed with the way you handled yourself, even though I don’t agree with you on the issue. I wish to lay out my own point of view, maybe so that we can come to an understanding.

I attended prestigious California schools for my high school, undergraduate, and PhD degrees. In all three places, a common refrain, usually but not always framed in humor, was that there were too many Asians. As I gradually gain more responsibilities in the university, it strikes me that this pervasive sentiment is the primary reason for affirmative action. Universities recognize that a large Asian contingent threatens to change the character—or at very least, the color—of venerated institutions.

This might seem like a crazy right-wing conspiracy theory, but it is based in what I have experienced in higher education, and perhaps part of this rings true to you as well. Keep in mind that the universities have a history of exactly this kind of discrimination with the Jewish quotas of the early 20th Century. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, UCLA itself was found to discriminate against Asian American applicants to its mathematics PhD program.

Furthermore, affirmative action supporters maintain that a “diverse” balance of students has positive educational effects. To achieve this balance, these people maintain that underrepresented students need to be enrolled in larger numbers, and as a corollary, “over-represented students”—which, by all accounts, includes Asian Americans—need to be limited. This essentially means that Asians can justifiably receive an admissions penalty because there are too many of us. Although at UC schools the Asian and white student populations are similar in size, Asians would stand receive a harsher penalty because their numbers in the California state population or in the US population are lower. I believe this is fallacious reasoning that overlooks the pathway to California that we have taken through the generations. Diversity seems to me like feel-good rhetoric which has no reality in pedagogy or social justice.

Now the supporters of ACA 5 would have us believe that recent events show there are racial effects that transcend socioeconomic class or other measures of disadvantage currently being considered by the University of California in admissions. Undoubtedly this is true, and my heart breaks for African Americans who must bear this ugly reminder of the racism that still exists in this country. But a preference for African American applicants, who even pre-209 did not have a proportionate share of the seats in the University of California, does not have to conflict with the need to preserve equal rights for Asian Americans.

I don’t believe that Assemblymember Weber’s intentions towards the Asian community are malicious. I am more worried about the intentions of the administration of the University of California, who it seems will have carte blanche after a Prop. 209 repeal to apply race-based preferences as it chooses, undoubtedly harming Asian Americans as they have been all around this country. 

There are many ways to compromise on this point. For example, the question on the UC application could have a question asking if the applicant identifies as Black, without further differentiating race, and the admissions committee could only use this information. Furthermore, the bill could abandon the diversity rationale which justifies excluding Asians for reasons of so-called ""over-representation."" I ask you, as a person who I greatly respect and who has the power to stand up for our community, to try to work with other legislators to achieve this. I look forward to hearing if you have other ideas along these lines.

Last Wednesday, you showed courage to stand for your principles despite opposition from your constituents. I hope you can show the same courage to stand up for the rights of Asian Americans in California.

et3j0b,,wyzra,1579831360.0,,"CMV: Affirmative action in universities is a deliberate attempt to limit the number of Asian students In all the debates about affirmative action, it seems like people just talk over each other. Neither side fully believes the argument the other puts forward.

I am against affirmative action, at least in its current implementation, because I believe that it's a calculated and deliberate attempt to limit the number of Asian students. I don't think I would change my stance about affirmative action as a whole, since I see the harmful side effects that it has, but my view on the intentionality behind the policies doesn't seem to be widely accepted and is a main reason for my opposition. If someone could soften my view on this particular point, I think it would help me stomach affirmative action a lot better.

I do believe that this country has a history of racism against black people and that part of that persists. But this seems to be a cover for blatant anti-Asian discrimination.

The most obvious thing is that there is a direct historical parallel to the Jewish quotas which were so widespread that only one medical school did not use quotas; this school was denied accreditation by the AMA and eventually became Brandeis University with some early input from prominent American Jews including Einstein and Brandeis. However, most universities never even admitted the existence of the quotas, to say nothing of apologies. The quotas directly led to the creation of the legacy and holistic admissions systems which gave space for affirmative action programs.

The letters of the Harvard president who implemented the Jewish quotas cited alumni influence as the major factor. On [Day 5](https://github.com/tyleransom/SFFAvHarvard-Docs/blob/master/TrialTranscripts/20181019-Day-5.pdf) of the Harvard trial there was (pg. 224) an alumnus who demanded the admissions committee cap the number of ""Orientals"" at 5%.  I don't believe this is an isolated incident, as it reflects the thinking of a lot of people in the older generation that I've encountered. The Director of Admissions there replied that this was a ""thoughtful"" suggestion and then went into a canned speech about how diversity is important. When I was an undergraduate, I attended an elite school with a large Asian population and there were constant complaints by parents, faculty, and even students about how many Asians there were.

According to this [interesting history](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/840/painful-admissions) on the Jewish quota, even administrators who weren't personally anti-Semitic were forced to go along with Jewish quotas since this was what the ""paying customers"" wanted. I think this might be similar to what's happening in higher education today. Who might these paying customers be today? Alumni, as we've already discussed, or legislators in racial ""caucuses"" (see [here](https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/california-passed-an-anti-affirmative-action-law-and-colleges-ignored-it/) or [here](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article2597061.html)) or private organizations. In my time working at the University of California, the faculty received lots of pressure from administrators who lobbied to try to repeal the ban (Prop. 209).

Another interesting historical fact is that even from the earliest days after lowering Asian exclusion immigration policy, Asians were discriminated against in college admissions. See for example this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/us/wider-door-at-top-colleges-sought-by-asian-americans.html) archived from 1989, or high profile cases like the University of California's apology for discriminatory policies in the late 80s and early 90s. This was before it was even widely known that Asian penalties were a standard part of ""affirmative action"". Nowadays, this practice is pretty much accepted even though there is no good historical or educational reason for doing so.

I'm curious, does everyone else have evidence that universities aren't primarily trying to limit the number of Asian students? As far as I can tell, they've avoided any explicit mention of *how* race factors into admissions or any criteria to measure how well affirmative action achieves ""diversity"" goals, or even what those are. It seems suspiciously like deliberately orchestrated discrimination. Change my view!",t5_2w2s8

>Rahim’s paper calls into question a critical component of this narrative: that Justice Powell was motivated by integrationist aims. By examining speeches, personal notes, and other writings from Powell’s archives that offer insight into his racial views, Rahim undermines the received wisdom that Powell was a segregationist prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, but that he became an integrationist during his time on the bench. He demonstrates “significant continuity” between Powell’s “views before he joined the Court and the way he voted as a Justice on key cases involving race and education during his tenure.” In the big picture, Rahim concludes, “Justice Powell spent considerable jurisprudential effort to limit the reach and effectiveness of racial integration.”  
>  
>If racial integration did not account for Justice Powell’s embrace of diversity in his *Bakke* concurrence, what did? This is where Rahim’s work really shines. He advances a fascinating new explanation: Justice Powell grew attracted to the idea of diversity because he feared radicalism. He believed that institutions of higher education were the site of radicalization for college students, who were targeted by radicals intent upon “infiltrat\[ing\] American universities in order to ‘brainwash’ the nation’s future leaders with anti-American propaganda.” Powell’s fears were stoked by waves of campus protests during the 1960s and 1970s. Importantly, however, Powell did not see radicals as predominantly non-white. Rather, he argued, “\[t\]he most visible element of the revolutionary movement is basically white and campus oriented.” Diversity, he believed, would serve as an antidote to such radicalization. But not just any diversity: the kind of intellectual diversity that would serve as a counterweight to the “new left” and moderate the radical forces on campus. This fascinating look into Justice Powell’s thinking explains why, for example, he quoted with approval Harvard’s statement that “\[a\] farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer.” Yes, diversity could include race, but mostly it was about neutralizing leftist forces.",t5_247ao9

Let People Vote ([https://www.letpeoplevote.org/](https://www.letpeoplevote.org/)) is an organization campaigning to defeat affirmative action in Washington in the November vote. Lawmakers in Washington state passed a last-minute bill that re-introduced racial preferences, against the long-standing ban overwhelmingly voted for by residents. This organization successfully took that law back to the vote and is now up against a corporate-funded pro-affirmative action campaign. They urgently need contributions! (UPDATE: the campaign was successful).

Students for Fair Admissions ([https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/)) is a group that represents Asian students who have been wrongly rejected from colleges and universities based on their race. After taking Harvard University to trial, they will need more funds to continue the battle in the First Circuit Court and eventually up to the Supreme Court. They are also interested in stories of students who have been discriminated against. A $10 membership is available and open to students, parents, or anyone else concerned about the issue.

The 80-20 Initiative ([http://www.80-20initiative.net/](http://www.80-20initiative.net/)) is a non-partisan advocacy group that aims to unite the Asian-American vote behind issues and candidates that are relevant for that group. In particular, they seek to end race-based discrimination in college admissions and were one of the main forces which dismantled California's SCA-5 bill to try to re-introduce affirmative action.

If you are an alum of a college or university that does not practice affirmative action (examples: University of California system, University of Michigan, Caltech, or Hillsdale) make a note on your contribution that you are proud that your school does not allow racial preferences.

ddijbn,,wyzra,1570249705.0,,"Legacy admissions and affirmative action A common tactic used by AA supporters is to bring up legacy admissions whenever AA is mentioned. Not only is this pure and simple whataboutism, it's simply uninformed.

During the trial, SFFA brought up legacy admissions to try to show that there were many unscrupulous practices in Harvard's admissions office and particularly by its dean William Fitzsimmons. Harvard and Ivy League presidents vigorously defended the practice. When told that diversity could be boosted by eliminating these special preferences (it is required to attempt race-neutral solutions before resorting to affirmative discrimination), they claimed that the legacy practice was an invaluable part of shaping the culture of the institution.

The judge in the Harvard case seemed to prefer the statistical model offered by Harvard over the one offered by SFFA since the SFFA model did not include recruited athletes, legacies, and developmental admits (ALDC). Somehow, Harvard convinced the judge that SFFA was trying to improperly narrow down the data set by these exclusions. They argued that because they don't discriminate against Asian American ALDC students, they are absolved of discrimination.

The popular narrative now, it seems, is that ALDC is a bigger problem than affirmative action. SFFA's statistics expert wrote a paper which revealed that 34% of white students at Harvard fell into the ALDC category, and AA supporters everywhere are coming out with the take that ALDC is the real problem. But to me, this is just admitting that ALDC applicants are indeed on a separate admissions track, thereby validating SFFA's model. And it's just another part of the bigger picture of unsavory preferences in admissions at elite schools.",t5_247ao9

ddf5f9,,wyzra,1570230606.0,,"SFFA's ""no plaintiffs"" problem in the Harvard trial The judge in the Harvard case repeatedly used the reasoning that because SFFA did not public present an Asian plaintiff to be the face of their claim, their position was somehow undermined.

>Further, throughout this trial, SFFA did not present a single admissions file that reflected any discriminatory animus, or even an application of an Asian American who it contended should have or would have been admitted absent an unfairly deflated personal rating. There thus remains the distinct possibility that a review of the available applications did not turn up a rejected Asian American applicant who was clearly more qualified than the white applicants who were admitted, or an applicant who received an obviously unjustified personal rating. This would strongly suggest that Asian American applicants were not discriminated against relative to white applicants and were therefore not unduly burdened by Harvard' s admissions program.

This ridiculous claim was repeated over and over by various media outlets.

First, there is legal precedent that cases of racial discrimination can be proven by statistical evidence alone, for example in Teamsters v. United States. And even the judge noted that SFFA did show that it had plaintiffs who had been harmed, although their names were not revealed publicly.

Why not? There is a history of harassment and retaliation against plaintiffs of affirmative action suits. Allan Bakke, who won a pivotal case striking down racial quotas in higher education, lived a guarded and intensely private life after his successful case. Abigail Fisher, whose case recently featured in the Supreme Court, received death threats and racial harassment (""Becky with the bad grades"", among worse things not fit to print) after the 4-3 decision against her in 2016. Furthermore, in academia and higher education circles, taking an anti-affirmative action stance is very unpopular and can result in damage to young careers.

The statistical evidence is really the most relevant information in this case. Harvard is selective enough that if one individual student is not accepted, no matter how qualified that student is, it would not raise eyebrows. It's only when an entire race is systematically discriminated against that the broad patterns begin to appear.

There is probably not any student who feels that their accomplishments in high school would guarantee a spot at Harvard bar racial discrimination. When a qualified student is rejected from Harvard due to affirmative action, the first instinct is not to mount a lawsuit against the university---it's to pick up the pieces and scramble to gain admission to another school of lesser means which is less suitable for their talents. SFFA, too, does not have access to confidential application information. But still they managed to find a number of plaintiffs that even this judge agreed had standing.

Then there's the issue of ""not a single admissions file."" The admissions files contain information which was given over reluctantly by Harvard after a long request process. It is doubtful that admissions officers would leave explicit racial comments in the applications for the record, no matter how important these were during the actual reading and committees that took place. The description of the lop process, where racial breakdowns were cumulatively tabulated and frequently announced as the final cuts and acceptances were being made, did not have a paper trail that was recorded in the admissions files.

Instead, we should, as SFFA did, let the overwhelming statistical evidence speak for itself.",t5_247ao9

dc529b,,wyzra,1569988775.0,,"My thoughts on the Harvard trial As we saw, the judge released her conclusions from the Harvard case. Here are my first impressions.

Her interpretation of the statistics is a bit muddled. See, for example, this sentence: 

>""Further, although Professor Arcidiacono's statistics suggest discrimination against certain subsets of Asian American applicants, Professor Card's analysis of this same data suggests the opposite, thereby leaving the statistical analyses inconclusive."" This is a sloppy reading of both reports.

The judge misuses figures when she claims that the percentage of Asian students at Harvard rose from 3.4% in 1980 to over 20% today. This doesn't account for the corresponding increase in the college-age Asian American population, the sudden increase in Asian admissions around the time these lawsuits were picking up, as well as the fact that Asians were discriminated against in 1980 also. And the following sentence is nonsense at best and overt racism at worst: 

>""Although Asian Americans can and do bring important and diverse perspectives to Harvard, because only about 6% of the United States population is Asian American compared to nearly a quarter of Harvard's class, it is reasonable for Harvard to determine that students from other minority backgrounds are more likely to offer perspectives that are less abundant in its classes and to therefore primarily offer race-based tips to those students."" 

It's not just racism against Asians, but for students of color who are continually called upon to explain their ""black experience"" in the classroom.

She decides to side with Card and Harvard, who used Asians' low personal rating to explain the difference in admissions between Asians and whites. On the other hand, Arcidiacono held that the personal rating was one of the mechanisms for discrimination against Asians. She doesn't give any reason for believing Harvard, other than the fact that Asians have a higher academic rating on average than other groups, and that both this and the lower personal rating are just statistical flukes. She speculates that racism from teachers and counselors might affect Asians' personal ratings, but attributes no intentional discrimination to the admissions officers.

She finds that 

>""The Court firmly believes that Asian Americans are not inherently less personable than any other demographic group, just as it believes that Asian Americans are not more intelligent or more gifted in extracurricular pursuits than any other group.""

 However, Asian Americans are not a representative sample of the Asian race as a whole. This group has undergone an intense selection process to enter the United States due to centuries of racist immigration law, and therefore group differences may be observed in the aggregate. Furthermore, the Asian American applicants might be more self-selected, due to knowledge that the standards are higher for Asian Americans than for other groups. What doesn't jive is that the correlation of personal rating to academic rating (and these are strongly correlated, according to the data) should fall so distinctly along racial lines.

The academic rating is based on numerical and objective criteria including grades, curriculum difficulty, and standardized test scores, whereas the personal rating is far more subjective. She fails to take this into account when comparing the two ratings.

In a cruel twist, she writes that eliminating AA would harm Asian students since 

>""removing considerations of race and ethnicity from Harvard's admissions process entirely would deprive applicants, including Asian American applicants, of their right to advocate the value of their unique background, heritage, and perspective and would likely also deprive Harvard of exceptional students who would be less likely to be admitted without a comprehensive understanding of their background."" 

But in other schools where affirmative action is banned, readers are allowed to consider relevant factors about race such as participation in ethnic clubs or personal essays addressing the subject. Harvard does more; as she writes earlier---

>""Harvard pursues its interest in diversity in part by considering the race of applicants, and its admissions officers may take an applicant's race into account when making an admissions decision even when the applicant has not discussed their racial or ethnic identity in their application."" 

Can we start by banning this?",t5_247ao9

cy7gi0,,wyzra,1567326007.0,,"My thoughts on the way forward I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while after I read certain interesting posts that really struck a chord of truth for me. I work at a large public university and I've been disturbed for some time about the issue of affirmative action: how I saw it used against Asians while I was in high school myself so many years ago, and what I see today in the university. I have written several articles about the issue published online.

The Simu Liu stuff piqued my interest recently. I have a family connection to Canada so I know him and watch his show. Someone on my Facebook linked to tweets which criticized him for just stating facts about the perception of Asian males in North America. It got me thinking about why people like Roslyn Talusan are so hostile towards Asian men and so oblivious to our issues.

The reason is that in these kind of debates, the extreme voices stand out. Roslyn, for example doesn't see Simu for the handsome, affable, and honest guy he is and immediately equates him with the trolls who harassed her because they have ""the same politics"". I've seen so many well thought-out posts on this subreddit, but if you're an AF who's been harassed by an online troll for AFWM stuff, then you're just going to remember the harassment. And Roslyn herself is an extreme voice, in my opinion, screaming half-truths to the world and covering up more moderate views.

On the flip side, not everyone is as hostile as Roslyn, and we should try to make those people our allies. For example, Celeste Ng, as problematic as her past tweets were, has acknowledged that there is a real problem surrounding the image of Asian men in the West. She even acknowledged her own internalized racism, although perhaps not as fully as some of us may like. But how can she be fully on our side when there are threatening messages posted about her child?

The political climate is perfect for achieving our goals. I have seen the power of the concept of ""whiteness"" diminish gradually over my lifetime. My home state, California, is becoming majority-minority, and non-white points of view are treated seriously in mass media. The situation has improved so much in just a few years.

So, wyzra, what can we do to move forward, and get there faster?

1. Let's stop using Uncle Chan and Lu terminology. Words used by a community to harm their own are never productive---after all, isn't that the same crime we're accusing them of at the same time?
2. End the obsession with AFWM. I get it, it can be creepy and it's rooted historically in all kinds of problematic stereotypes. To be clear, it is a huge issue for our community. We look at the aggregate and see the disturbing trend. But we can't assume that any individual couple (like Celeste Ng and her husband) are just there to satisfy some sick fetish. The demographics suck for Asian guys, but none of us seriously wants to say that AF must date exclusively AM. And at the same time, we should recognize that AFs are victims of internalized racism, and that many times they don't even see it. I had a half-Asian friend who looked basically full Chinese and she kept on insisting that she looked more white (and I read most hapas as white, myself). Instead of attacking, we should be compassionate for them. Things will get better as the underlying root issues are addressed.
3. Have a thick skin and don't take small slights too seriously. When people started saying ""All Lives Matter"", the BLM people were rightfully outraged. But they let the discussion become stuck at that point, which I think really derailed the conversation and lost them a lot of sympathy. We have to hold strong to our main points and not get too sidetracked by the little things.
4. Make it a point in our community to denounce trolls. I know that we already don't condone harassment here, but we need to go a step further. If Jenn or Celeste or someone complains about a troll, we shouldn't say ""yeah, but they have a point!"" Martin Luther King was so much more effective than other activists like Malcolm X because he chose a deliberate non-violent way to protest, even though the conditions in the pre-Civil Rights era didn't necessarily warrant that. Once the threat of terrorism and violence was removed, people couldn't point to that as a boogeyman and were forced to see their own racism.
5. Accept imperfect allies. I believe our issue is an important one with parallels to other issues championed by people from across the political spectrum, from far-left to alt-right. We don't have to agree 100% with everyone all the time. Try to stick to the issue and make them think about it for themselves.
6. Get knowledgeable and help out with important causes like stamping out affirmative action. Being a keyboard warrior only gets one so far.

Anyways, hope it doesn't sound too critical. I really identify with this community the most out of all the Asian-American communities on reddit. By organizing together under sound principles I believe we can affect some real change.",t5_3amv4

But let's see how this practice is in reality. In the Harvard example there, white students get a 50% advantage (6 to 9) over similar Asian students. Also in that article you can read that disadvantaged black students don't get any preferences over privileged black students. Why do they do it this way?

It really seems like the purpose is to prevent the school from being so Asian. I mean, from all the discussions I've had in the past few days on Reddit, most people think it's a foregone conclusion that it's a bad thing to have a school be, say, 40% Asian.

Why?

The previous SC rulings were very suspicious of the use of race. They thought of many safeguards to limit its use: it had to have a clear, quantifiable benefit for the gov't; it had to be a relatively small effect, minimal needed to achieve the benefit. In 1978, Supreme Court opinion suggested that it might be only used for 10 more years for the project of integrating schools.

But the universities liked having the power to hand-pick their classes to achieve their cultures built up on prestige. It turned out that the true purpose of affirmative action did not benefit the government, so they had to make up something vague that sounded plausible: diversity. And the effect was actually relatively large, so they had to make sure not to be able to quantify it and be restricted to the minimal application.

And what is that true purpose? To limit East and South Asians, who were rapidly increasing among the ranks of elite schools in the 1980s as immigration opened up and the children of immigrants were coming of age. Although they performed well academically, they did not fit into the culture the schools were trying to breed, being on the other side of the classical divide between East and West. Affirmative action was a powerful tool for schools to actively discriminate against them while under the cover of social justice and diversity.

Even if affirmative action were about helping Black people (which even the lawyers for the universities say it's just for diversity), there's no reason to lay so much of the burden particularly with Asians. It's very clear that keeping Asian numbers low is part of it. 

From my perspective it's kind of like making Black people use segregated water fountains to conserve water for everyone else. They're violating innocent people's civil rights for something that doesn't even solve the problem that supposedly necessitated it, a problem that has tons of possible more effective solutions that don't involve the discrimination.

They might think, for example, that they don't just take the race as it's marked down on the checkbox. That they go back and investigate and find every time someone called you a slur or investigate the genealogy to discover that your ancestors were redlined against and then used a complex, well-researched algorithm to find out how much disadvantage you had to overcome. I believe most people would think that this is not racism since it doesn't just stereotype based on whether you're white or Black or Asian or whatever. 

Or, that they might just consider race if you wrote about learning some complex Indian dance or took a trip to Africa to discover more about your ancestors or something like that.

Or maybe if your skin is dark enough then it's automatic admission? I think talking about this ""determinative factor"" issue is a little disingenuous in the discussion of affirmative action.

Since you already read it, Arcidiacono's research showed that the admissions chances for black students to Harvard are about quadrupled compared to similarly situated Asian students. In Card's study, it was roughly tripled.

The main differences in Card's and Arcidiacono's analyses are:

1) Card includes ""ALDC"" students (legacies, athletes, and other backdoor channels) in his analysis. It was found that Asian students who fall into these categories are admitted at higher rates. Card says this effect is evidence that there is no Asian discrimination when in fact it is actually consistent with the discrimination hypothesis, since Harvard admits the admission process here is a separate pathway from the general one.

2) Card finds out that once you add variables like geography, neighborhood characteristics, high school characteristics, parents information (deceased or not, occupations, Ivy League college/ Harvard graduate school attendance), place of birth, citizenship/residency status, and work hours, and personality rating, then there is only a small (possibly statistically insignificant) penalty for Asians against whites. This is a typical kind of overfitting argument, just like I'm fairly sure that the average 6'9, 250 lb, 35 year old black man born in Akron living in Los Angeles with 3 children and an affinity for tacos is probably a great basketball player. Furthermore, Arcidiacono posits that the personality rating is part of the mechanism under which discrimination is taking place, as racial effects seem to have a strong influence on this metric. Card is able to hide the discrimination in these other variables (particularly, geography, high school, citizenship status, parental occupations, and personal rating are not independent variables from race, given certain history of this country and Asian immigration).

(1) Perception that Asians don't need help/have lots of privilege, since on average the Asian community in the United States has a slightly higher median household income than other groups.

(2) Higher proportion of Asians in the institution compared to the US or state population. Many of these programs have an explicit goal of mirroring the demographics of the area served.

(3) Lack of political representation. Many of these affirmative action programs are strongly pushed by politicians or groups advocating for specifically racial issues, while Asians have few representatives to defend us.

While Scott Paulo has given a succinct history of institutional racism re. Blacks and calls for the return to affirmative action, I respectfully believe otherwise.

I am a descendent of Asian immigrants who entered the U.S. before the 1924 exclusion act. They were denied naturalization, could not buy farm land and suffered discrimination while working for sugar plantations in Hawaii. During WWII their counterparts  in California,  regardless of citizenship,  were summarily imprisoned in concentration camps located in either the mountains of Idaho and Wyoming, the deserts of California or the swamps of Arkansas merely because “they had the face of the enemy” and were immediately suspected of spying without any proof.

Then, after their return to California, they survived many hardships including discrimination of housing and employment, but  the former immigrants finally achieved naturalization in 1952, and through their determination their children could succeed via hard work and education, and they have come a long way without the aid of affirmative action. During the years since California abandoned affirmative action I believe Blacks as well as Latinos have had equal opportunity through their own merit as well, and do not need a return to a law that can be discriminatory as well.

(1) This seems like a practical consideration in conflict with the hard-learned lesson of non-discrimination. Well, some people (most, even?) prefer to interact and work with people who are similar to themselves. So it's conceivable that homogeneity might be really beneficial. Could we appeal to the well-documented benefits of homogeneity to exclude minorities?

(2) I'm fine with adding legitimate diversity in race-neutral ways. I don't think it would be discrimination if a restaurant wanted to hire, say, a candidate who could cook the best Italian food (regardless of their race), but I guess it would be if they only wanted to hire white Italians.

I think you already nailed the difference with the lefty pitcher. It's because affirmative action involves RACIAL discrimination that we've developed a strong moral distaste against.

Yeah, but not all black people suffer the same kinds of disadvantages. Affirmative action refers specifically to the use of race as a factor in selection. In settings where affirmative action has been banned, people can still write in their essays if, for example, some act of racism influenced their life. Their family's socioeconomic status or school environment can also be taken into account. It is the use of the race alone that affirmative action allows, and the putative reason for this is DIVERSITY. The colleges are not arguing that they are trying to account for any kind of disadvantage, they specifically want more students of some races and less of others.

If your parents were able to go to college, you are much more likely to be able to go then someone whose parents *didn't* go to college.

Except affirmative action now mostly applies to selective institutions. Since the early 2010s, non-selective colleges have been experiencing an enrollment crisis and are eager to accept new students. In the same time period, these schools stopped using affirmative action policies.

The magnitude of the preference is notable enough that if you go to any college admissions site/subreddit, the race is always stated in the list of qualifications when discussing an applicant. The data that Harvard released [showed](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27068) that an Asian student whose qualifications give a 25% chance of admission to Harvard has about a 30% chance if she were white (all else being equal) and a 90% chance if black.

It is true that white women have made large gains during the period where affirmative action was implemented, but that's because of changes in our society as a whole that are much more supportive towards women joining the workforce.

Even the difference between whites and Asians, about 30 points per section or 90 points overall, is big and statistically significant.

The admit rate difference is big too. Asians have an acceptance rate 38% lower than blacks despite Asian applicants having more than 300 points more in the SAT on average.

I think this is intentional discrimination already, in the absence of any better reasoning.

However, I do think that the reasons go deeper than this. Limiting the numbers of domestic students of Chinese and Indian descent to make room for international Chinese and Indians counts to me as intentional discrimination. This is a willful act targeted against a specific racial demographic whose rationale is not morally valid.

Second, the malicious intent can be borne out by the empirical evidence. Asians did not benefit from the racism in the pre-Civil Rights Era as whites did, and therefore to penalize them more than whites in the name of racial justice is absurd (indeed, the universities do this for ""diversity"" as discussed before, but this is also flawed for many reasons).

Different cultures have lots of different ways of doing things, ranging from different cuisines to different perspectives on the world, and people stand to gain from this. I believe there's value in the demographics reflecting non-discriminatory admissions policies, so that one group isn't systematically oppressed in favor of the others (like what's happening with Asians).

What I don't believe is that one student's racial identification has any more or less value than any other's. The way affirmative action works now is that the race you put down in the box can be used as a ""factor""---technically it's supposed to be used to paint a holistic picture with the rest of the application, but this is not true in practice and anyways impossible to actually distinguish the difference.

If you want to select for cultural diversity, then select based on those specific cultural traits you wish to cultivate. For example, if you want an erhu player for your ethnomusicology program, find the best erhu player (not necessarily a Chinese person). If you want a good basketball player for the school team, then just find the best basketball player instead of mass enrolling black students. America has traditionally been all about assimilation into the greater American culture, so it doesn't make sense to select by race.
 
Diversity and inclusion programs are mostly staffed with legal counsel to make sure that affirmative action programs (at least visibly outward) conform to legal requirements. There might be some people staffing these offices who do care about the goal of diversity, but the reason for existence of these programs is to cover the university's intentional discrimination.

It's just like how every university has a Title IX and equity office. However, universities are notoriously bad at dealing with cases of sexual assault and have historically used these offices to deny their liability and silence victims.

Then since black people in Iceland would be much wealthier than whites on average, does it stand that to achieve diversity at Reykjavik University they should use affirmative discrimination on black people? 

Let's put it another way. In the 1980s there was a large Asian immigration to the US of skilled workers, that's why Asians have higher incomes on average than other races. There were also large contingents coming from countries like Nigeria and Russia. However, it happened that there were already lots of black and white people in the US, so they weren't treated as especially privileged. For the Asian immigrants, however, almost a century of exclusion from the US caused these people to make up most of their race. So now their kids get affirmative discrimination benefits because their skin color just happened to match people already here?

Anyway, none of this has to do with the idea that schools are intentionally excluding Asian students. I think that you mentioned that whites can call ""dibs"" to maintain cultural supremacy at universities.

I think that it's definitely true that at some point this was the goal of affirmative action. But I think somewhere down the line the focus shifted to controlling the burgeoning number of Asians (sometime in the late 1980s when Asians started immigrating in numbers).

They accept a large amount of foreign students from countries where they don't have to provide financial aid, like Saudi Arabia and China. They are making a lot of money off of these students.

Affirmative action broadly speaking is a government policy, but in this case the specific mechanism I'm talking about here is the policy that the universities create and implement. There is some conflict with the government; for example the US Department of Justice is currently investigating the anti-Asian discrimination at several universities.

Universities are taking many foreign Asian students because they pay full tuition. Domestic Asian students are generally limited to about 15-20% at elite schools. Without affirmative action, there are estimates that Asians would make up more than 40% of the class, as is found in other universities without affirmative action (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/harvard-admissions-lawsuit-trial-asian-american-discrimination-reports.html).

>>On a more broader generalization, generally the goal is for admissions to be roughly proportional to population (which is what you'd expect of an unbiased system)

This is the most puzzling to me. Seems like in an unbiased system, you could argue that all the acceptance rates would be equal, since the admissions process only happens with people who actually apply, but Asians consistently have the lowest acceptance rate year after year. This is not to mention the extra outreach done for other groups (Asians needed to have an SAT score higher than whites to receive a letter inviting them to apply to Harvard).

And because of the US immigration policy, I wouldn't expect admissions to be proportional to population. The Asian immigrants who come to the US are disproportionately highly educated workers and refugees. They aren't just a representative average sample taken from their home countries.

Whites are about 70% of the US population. So it seems to me that by your standard they are a very ""under-represented"" group at elite universities, where they generally make up only about 50% of the students.",t5_2w2s8

Just about any racial stereotype can be broken down into more meaningful causal variables.

Every state that has taken the issue to a vote has banned it, except Colorado. And it would almost certainly have been declared unconstitutional had Antonin Scalia not passed away at an inopportune time. 

Generally, affirmative action sticks around because influential companies and schools value their right to discriminate. For example, in the recent Washington affirmative action vote, the pro-affirmative action side was driven by corporate sponsors and Democratic party politicians, while the anti- side was grassroots Asian-American and veteran activism. The Supreme Court case, as well, was pushed through right after Scalia died (he died in February, and the case was decided in June). Typically, the Court rehears cases after the appointment of a new justice, but I bet some influential person demanded the decision right away. Large majorities of each race do not support the explicit use of race as a factor in college admissions, which is all affirmative action really means behind the loaded political connotations.

I agree that the real problem is that whites have an advantage over Asians because of their race. I'm even more cynical than you here. I think that affirmative action is put in place today ONLY to take seats from Asians and give them to whites. The fact that blacks and Hispanics seem to benefit from the policies is just a cover for that. In every university I've worked at, they could do way more to help the blacks and Hispanics who are already there succeed, but they only care about them at the admissions stage.

But part of the problem is an interpretation of the law that gives schools the right to use race as a factor in making these admissions decisions. I would definitely support a program that aims to help people who are low-income or disadvantaged in some way to access opportunity, even if this program happened to help out black or Latino people more than Asians.

Instead, it's used to increase racial diversity which supposedly increases productivity and better prepares students for entering the workforce. In one interview I had with an admissions officer, she told me that it was a matter of ""supply and demand"". My interpretation is that because Asians are apparently applying to top universities in large numbers, the admissions committees place a lower value on Asian identity than those of other races.

People have a huge blind spot when it comes to this kind of blatant anti-Asian racism. Just look at the recent ruling by the judge in the Harvard trial. She saw that there was evidence of discrimination but she brushed it aside for the supposed benefits of diversity, which are never really quantified or critically analyzed.

Affirmative action programs are allowed to run without any accountability, and schools do not have to provide any evidence that they are conforming to the very narrow allowable use cases. I would be OK with a program that deliberately addresses past discrimination (and this is legal for schools like Texas which have an institutional history of that kind of discrimination) but in the current implementation, the policies are all solidly anti-Asian for no justifiable reason.

I know a bit about how it's implemented because I'm a faculty member at a university. The university uses AA in both undergraduate admissions and hiring faculty (my department does not use affirmative action in graduate admissions, but I believe other departments do). Before Gratz v. Bollinger, the University of Michigan and other schools used a point system to determine admission, and they awarded more points for being black, Hispanic, and Latino than for being in-state in Michigan. After Gratz, this was deemed illegal, but this was only 16 years ago, and the supposedly legal systems that use ""goals"" instead of quotas have largely the same effects.

The general public doesn't know much about how these programs work, since the details are deliberately withheld from us by the universities. I believe that how it works is that admissions officers evaluate each applicant in the context of their race, so that essentially people are only competing against others of the same race (while this is illegal, it would be very hard to detect). The effect of affirmative action is large. I went to a very competitive high school, and our guidance counselors gave students honest advice for what schools to apply to based on their race. And this was borne out by the acceptance stats of previous classes, which they showed us to help make our decisions.

I'm a member of Students for Fair Admissions, and in the recent trial it was revealed that the average SAT score for Asian admits was about 50 points higher than for whites, and 150 points higher than for blacks at Harvard. This seems like a huge difference which can't be explained by other factors.

In my university, we have a detailed affirmative action plan for hiring. This means that some percentage of interviews offered for each position must go to women candidates (I'm relatively OK with this kind of soft consideration). Whenever a man is hired over a woman, we must write a report to the administration which details why the male candidate is superior (I think this is OK as well). But then, the affirmative action office at the university--people who aren't really qualified to judge the credentials of potential faculty members)--reserves the right to rescind offers if they don't feel like the male candidate is better in every dimension than the female candidate. They actually used this power last year, causing a lot of turmoil in the department. And in our affirmative action plan, minorities don't really receive any special consideration (ironically, because qualified  non-white or Asian applicants are not too common).

SEATTLE

The deep-blue state of Washington decided 21 years ago to end race-based affirmative action in college admissions and public hiring. Fifty-eight percent of voters approved Initiative 200 in 1998 to prevent the government “from discriminating or granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in public employment, education, and contracting.” But in April, Democrats in Olympia brought racial preferences back to the Evergreen State by passing a measure called Initiative 1000. It would have become law in July, but opponents collected enough signatures to force the question onto the Nov. 5 ballot. Now Washington voters will get their say on Referendum 88, which asks them either to affirm or reject I-1000.

The fight over I-1000 is a classic clash between equality and equity. Equality means everyone plays by the same rules. Equity requires the rules to be different because people are different. But while the fight is familiar, the players aren’t. The campaign against I-1000 has been led by Linda Yang, head of Washington Asians for Equality, who emigrated from China in 1995 with $200 in her pocket. This is her first political campaign.

Ms. Yang told state lawmakers at a hearing earlier this year that she has frequently experienced discrimination. “When one of my managers wanted to promote a less qualified male Caucasian candidate over me, I walked into his office and gave him a list why I was more qualified,” she said. “I did not say I was a woman. I did not say that I was a minority. I said I was more qualified. . . . I refuse to play the identity-politics card.”

Asians for Equality stunned seasoned political observers over the past six months by collecting more than 650 donations from Microsoft employees, even as the Redmond-based company itself endorsed I-1000. As of mid-October not a single Microsoft worker had made a donation to support I-1000. The campaign against I-1000 has collected 272 donations from Amazon employees since May. Employees at Google, Facebook and eBay have also donated, suggesting that even notoriously liberal tech workers have grown weary of identity politics. Perhaps they believe that discriminating against Asians, whites and men is as wrong as discriminating against blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics and women.

Unlike Ms. Yang’s campaign, the One Washington Equality Campaign, a pro-affirmative-action group that led the initial effort to pass I-1000 earlier this year, was funded by a handful of big donors—primarily Native American tribes, labor unions, and a prominent Seattle law firm. When an outstanding bill of $1.3 million owed to their signature-gathering companies snagged the campaign’s momentum, supporters led by the State Labor Council—the Washington branch of the AFL-CIO—registered a separate organization in August. That group, the Washington Fairness Coalition, has collected more than $1 million—not to pay the stiffed signature gatherers, but for last-minute TV advertising and a voter-turnout blitz. They have a clear financial advantage over the anti-affirmative-action movement heading into the campaign’s home stretch.

Initiative supporters promise the measure will expand opportunities for veterans. Actually, it would threaten the state’s longstanding preference program for veterans in government employment and contracting, which dates back more than a century. Under I-1000, an earned preference for service to country would be legally equated with an intrinsic preference based on race or sex. The Washington State Veterans Bar Association opposes the measure, with one member calling it a “slap in the face to veterans.”

It goes without saying that I-1000 supporters want a large new bureaucracy to enforce the law’s diversity standards. A commission, largely appointed by the governor, would have the authority to set and enforce hiring and admissions “goals.”

In 1998 I led the I-200 campaign to end racial preferences in Washington with the help of Ward Connerly, the black University of California regent who led the nation’s first successful campaign against preferences, in the Golden State. I tried but failed to engage the Asian-American community in that campaign. The tech community in those days was also largely uninterested. Almost every corner of the state’s cultural and political establishment was against us. But despite being outspent by more than 3 to 1, we persuaded Washington voters to replace the system of diversity through discrimination with equality for all, regardless of race.

Twenty-one years later the coalition against preferences is larger and more diverse. “If I-1000 is passed,” says Ms. Yang, “my children and grandchildren will forever be judged not as individual Americans, but as members of their race. I can’t sit still and let that happen.” I can’t either.

f4yw699,t1_f4yukm9,wyzra,1571886846.0,,"Well actually I am a professional educator and mathematician working in a university for a living but no one in the Court asked me for my input, nor have any of my colleagues ever been approached to ask how diversity impacts the quality of education. The only people who get asked are admissions officers, deans, university presidents, and provosts who occupy administrative positions that have about as much to do with education as whatever your job is. The job of the upper-tier administrators in the university is primarily fundraising and lobbying for the university.

On the other hand, I and other faculty have been pressured to go along with ill-conceived diversity initiatives forced upon us by administrators, some of which have had disastrous consequences.

I did not follow the Fisher case closely since I knew it would be difficult to argue as most of their class was constructed by the race-neutral ten percent plan. But I can tell you in the Harvard case, the standards of strict scrutiny were satisfied by short documents drafted by a four-person committee after just a few meetings. You can find those documents here: https://github.com/tyleransom/SFFAvHarvard-Docs/tree/master/TrialExhibits

I did talk to someone at UT who worked on the affirmative action policy for their law school. He told me that they crafted the policy with the discrimination that UT had historically perpetrated against blacks and Hispanics solidly in mind. He said that he didn't see that other schools like the University of California system could have the same rationale. 

I just looked over the documents you mentioned and I don't see any real quantitative evidence of the benefits of diversity. I also couldn't find any real third-party investigation of the university's methodology, they just accept whatever the admissions officers say. So how does this meet strict scrutiny? 

I think if Scalia happened not to pass away at such an inopportune time, we'd have a much different story on our hands. It's expected that the current Court's composition is much more favorable to my position. But anyways, I think we're qualified enough to interpret what's right and wrong for ourselves.",t5_2w2s8
f4yqecc,t1_f4ylcto,wyzra,1571882677.0,,"Right, but I'm not sure about what the rules are. I agree with the Constitution, whose Equal Protection Clause states: ""No State shall...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" This can only be violated when the state has a ""compelling interest"" to do so, and in these cases the violation must only be the minimal sufficient to fulfill that interest.

I don't agree that universities are trying to serve some broader interest in using affirmative action. They have never really demonstrated this, the court just gives them significant deference in determining the educational value of diversity without ever asking for any evidence whatsoever. Especially if diversity is so important in education, how do you quantify the amount of diversity? For example, UCLA with its 40% Asians is considered by AA proponents to be an example of a school which lacks diversity but by USNews metric it is the most diverse public school in the country.

And I'd like to know what kind of bounds there are for doing this discrimination. You mentioned that race is ""one of many factors"" used in the decisions. What are the other factors? Like SAT score, GPA, and so on? This sets the bar artificially high as then the only time deciding in favor of one applicant over another due to their race counts as discrimination is when the accepted applicant of the right race has worse qualifications in every other way. So if a black (or even white) student who has a better GPA but worse SAT scores, curriculum strength, extracurricular activities, and teacher recommendations is selected over an Asian student, then it doesn't count as illegal discrimination? I really don't think this passes ""strict scrutiny"".

I just want to know what you think a constitutionally acceptable AA program looks like. Is any race favored over another, and for what reason? Like I get that you can give a ""tip"" to a certain person based on their race, but what decides the magnitude of this tip?

And while this is an admirable goal, it was quickly realized that the beneficiaries of these preferences were not necessarily those who had suffered the lasting effects of that discrimination, and the people who shouldered the cost did not necessarily benefit from slavery.

As a result, the legal justification for these programs were getting shakier and shakier. But the institutions were under pressure to maintain the programs for several reasons. First, there was a lot of pressure from protests and various organizations who championed the programs (as reparations). They were also struggling to maintain their legacy programs in the face of racial disparities. And finally, Asian immigrants were starting to arrive in numbers in the US and they disproportionately occupied spots in US universities. Similar to the widespread Jewish exclusion earlier in the century, the universities felt the urgent need to hold back their numbers.

A legal genius named [Archibald Cox](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4067&context=facpubs) devised the diversity rationale to justify Harvard's practices. This came four years before Bakke and Powell's opinion is almost plagiarized from Cox's amicus brief.

The diversity rationale was perfectly suited for its role. It did not set any time limits on the use of affirmative action, as diversity would be considered a ""compelling interest"" in perpetuity even as racial discrimination became culturally irrelevant. The correct diverse mix to ensure the best outcomes was nebulously defined and so the schools could adjust the racial mix as best suited their interests without any regard to external factors. And finally, they could justify holding down numbers of certain minorities like Asians, Arabs, and Jews who had suffered discrimination but were ""overrepresented"" in terms of their share of the general population.",t5_2w2s8

I don't see what the difference is. A black person can probably get a loan from a different bank. And the problem is that all upper tier schools practice affirmative action except for Caltech, and the top flagship state schools do as well. So it's very likely for an Asian student to be shut out from all top schools (and this happened to Michael Wang, who initiated a lot of these lawsuits). Besides, just because Asian students can scramble to find workable alternatives doesn't make it OK. Ben Carson took a lot of heat for saying he didn't think Muslims should be president. I'm sure a Muslim person who is in the position to run can have a good life even if they don't become president, but it doesn't make it OK to shut out an entire group from a position of power.

&#x200B;

There are definitely studies that show a relationship between skin color and financial capability. For example, this [report](https://www.badcredit.org/african-americans-are-more-likely-to-have-bad-credit/) showing the credit disparity between blacks and whites. You can find tons of studies like this. Then people extrapolate that to all members of the black community, which leads to situations like you described with the loan. I'm saying this is bad behavior, just like affirmative action is.

&#x200B;

>I think the support for affirmative action in people who can see the racism inherent in those other situations speaks volumes about the way the US perceives Asian people.

By this I mean for example that in the face of obvious discrimination people tend to just look the other way and rationalize it away. Like when the Harvard lawsuit was ongoing, a lot of supposedly woke people came out to the courthouse with signs like ""defend diversity"" and pro-affirmative action signs. Maybe those things are worth defending, but the trial was specifically about the obvious discrimination against Asians. It's like going to a Black Lives Matter event holding a sign that says ""all lives matter"" or ""blue lives matter"". While those lives do, of course, also matter---it's besides the point. But people instinctively recognize that and rush to the defense of the BLM movement, whereas for Asians people just show the apathy evident in your replies.",t5_2w2s8

First, affirmative action is primarily concerned with race over any other factors, so it isn’t implemented in a way that gives the benefits you describe. Your socio-economic model, if I may read between the lines, is that children generally achieve similar income/class as their parents (this preserving the “ratio” in your post). But if this is the case, then affirmative action for children of wealthy black parents has no positive societal effect, yet proponents of affirmative action argue that these children also deserve preference over Asians and whites even from the lower class or in disadvantaged minorities.

And that’s because the official reason for affirmative action is “diversity”, where people of certain races are selected because their skin color has something to teach us in a wider sense. Diversity means fixating on race to balance everyone according to their percentage in the US (and not, say, in the world or in a particular state or in the college age population). This means that Asians are brought down a notch and Hispanics are raised up—despite the fact that their population in the US is extremely self-selected, with Asian immigration restricted for years by racist laws and opened up only for waves of students and highly skilled technology workers, and immigration from Latin America driven by the demand for farm workers. (and therefore we shouldn’t expect these groups to be exactly proportionate). Or that the label Asian includes many populations of refugees seeking asylum and Hispanic includes European Spanish people and Cubans, which are very high performing subgroups.

And being in academe myself, I can tell you that there is an intense pressure from finding agencies and government to keep up affirmative action at all costs, which makes it so that compliance is more important than careful consideration or true effectiveness.

UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority minority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the University would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11– 345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit “[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas”)

Well, one thing is that they discriminate against people based on certain characteristics like skin color or ethnicity that don't necessarily correspond to your definition of culture. For example, the children of Nigerian and Caribbean immigrants count as black, but these families already have a strong culture of learning and education, so the large amounts of affirmative action they receive doesn't lift up their communities. And most of the generational African Americans that receive it for the top schools are from wealthy families in wealthy neighborhoods, so they also don't receive the benefit.

These types of programs contribute to racial tension, not mitigate it, since many white and Asian people in America are very strongly against this discrimination and feel disenfranchised by it. You can see this from all of the action the Trump justice department is taking against AA policies, and by the mobilization of Chinese-American political groups.

You can have a world where you do affirmative action (and thus discriminate against Asian-Americans) with both non-legacy applicants and legacy applicants (which I think was the world we lived in before the supreme court decision, thought I'm not 100% on this). You can also have a world where you do affirmative action with non-legacy applicants but not with legacy applicants (a world where colleges treat non-legacies the way we're familiar with but with legacies, for whatever reason, colleges become totally race-blind because they feel legacies are just special like that).

You can also have a world where giving an advantage to legacy applicants is banned so all applicants are effectively non-legacies, but the college does affirmative action for all these non-legacy applicants. This is what would have happened if the supreme court ruled in favor of affirmative action but against legacy admissions. Since legacies are mostly white, the proportion of white students in an entering class should go down. Those legacy white students would be replaced by non-legacies, which are made up of: non-legacy whites, non-legacy Asian-Americans, non-legacy Latinos, and non-legacy blacks. And in the competition for those seats, non-legacy Asian-Americans would still be discriminated against in the name of affirmative action compared to all the other non-legacy races.

You can also have a world where affirmative action is banned but legacies are still allowed (where we are currently and probably where we'll be in the future since non-legacy isn't a protected class and thus, at least legally speaking, legacy admissions are unlikely to be struck down). Legacies are mostly white, but what it means is that you can't discriminate against non-legacy Asian-Americans in favor of non-legacies of other races, and you can't discriminate against legacy Asian-Americans in favor of other legacy races.

It's a bit confusing with all the theoretical possibilities, but the TLDR is that only getting rid of legacies doesn't get rid of Asian-American discrimination (in fact, it doesn't affect it at all). It may decrease the proportion of white students in a student body, but not by as much as some people think since the empty seat that was formerly filled by a legacy white student may be filled by a non-legacy white student. The point is that the relative disadvantage that an Asian-American faces due to the discriminatory nature of affirmative action is the problem. If legacies are banned and a white legacy student's seat is emptied, if in the competition for that empty seat a non-legacy Asian-American applicant is discriminated against in favor of non-legacies of other races, that is the same problem we had all along.",t5_3amv4

I admit I didn't watch the interview, but what someone from her generation needs to sorely realize before voicing their opinion is that affirmative action for someone who went through college admissions in the 1980s and before is different from someone who went through it in the [1990s](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/22/asian-american-admit-sat-scores/) and [afterwards](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/19/acceptance-rates-by-race/). The policy may very well have helped some Asian Americans from that generation, but that's not relevant to affirmative action today (or rather, since the 1990s). Someone as well educated as a judge should've bothered to check the evidence.

In addition, someone as familiar with the law as a judge should think about how shaky the ground is for affirmative action when Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 says that:

>No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color ... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

[Archived version](https://archive.ph/EtVGy)

I don't know who the author is and his Wikipedia article shows him to be not held in the highest regard by some intellectuals, including philosophers: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley\_Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Fish). Nevertheless, I'm glad to have found an article connecting the currently hot topic of race-based affirmative action in higher education and the philosophical argument of utilitarianism vs Kant as most recent articles on the internet are about the societal and legal side of it.

The article was written in 2007 in the wake of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative or Prop 2, which banned affirmative action in Michigan. A thing to keep in mind is that 2007 is before Ron Unz's 2012 article ""The Myth of American Meritocracy,"" which is what kick-started the whole evidence-digging of Harvard's admissions policy and the lawsuit brought by Students For Fair Admissions (SFFA) against Harvard. Thus, both the article itself and the comments by readers below the article on the NY Times webpage are entering the discussion without the evidence that came out afterwards (namely about Asian-Americans. Ctrl+f for ""asian"" on the webpage and there isn't a single mention in the article nor the comments). However, before the 2023 supreme court case, in 2019 a District of Massachusetts court decision used the same(?) or same-ish evidence that was used in the 2023 supreme court case and ruled in favor of Harvard, so for some people the new post-2007 (or post-2012) evidence may not change their conclusions.

The article points out that Kant disregards the outcome of a policy. The policy must be moral in itself. So if someone argues that affirmative action is a good policy because it brings about a desired outcome (eg. giving an advantage to historically disadvantaged races, creating a diverse student body), this would not be accepted by Kant. A quote from Clarence Thomas that the author uses: “It is irrelevant whether a government’s racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged. In each instance, it is racial discrimination, pure and simple.

”The author writes about Kant's position that ""... at some point you might decide that your goal would be better served by a little deception and secrecy (just as some have said in recent years that the protection of democracy requires doing undemocratic things), and at that point morality will have given way to expediency and considerations of prudence."" One might say that a peculiarly prominent and optically bad manifestation of this is what happened according to the evidence that came up in the 2023 case - the deliberate disadvantaging of Asian-Americans in college admissions (if that is what you conclude from the evidence. The Harvard side of the case and the 2019 verdict of course disagrees with that). What's a little racial discrimination against Asian-Americans if it serves the greater good of affirmative action? It's the age-old ""greater good"" versus ""individual rights"" question. The individuals who are deliberately disadvantaged by the policy are used as a means to achieve the ends of the ""greater good"" of affirmative action.

There are some rebuttals mentioned in the article. One comes from students of the author who, ""conclude that Kant would have been in favor of affirmative action because, they reasoned, it was the denial of freedom and equality to African Americans that produced the injustices affirmative action is intended to redress."" But as described above, using other people (the people who end up being hurt by the policy) as a means is not Kantian. If the good produced by helping some students in to a college somehow outweighs the bad produced by disadvantaging other students, that obviously would also not be Kantian, but obviously it would be right up a utilitarian's alley. One can find a [study](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-22/prop-209s-affirmative-action-ban-drove-down-black-and-latino-uc-enrollment-and-wages-study-finds) that says that after affirmative action ended in California in 1996 due to Prop 209, Black and Latino students' graduation rates dropped and their wages were driven down while ""Asian Americans and whites were not significantly disadvantaged by affirmative action nor particularly benefited from its repeal"" and also find a [study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130626) that says less prepared minority students at selective colleges switched out of STEM majors (found it too difficult) where they wouldn't have switched out at less selective colleges, thus complicating the picture. In the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case, Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, “We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary,"" which in a 2009 essay she somewhat backtracked on, saying ""That 25-year expectation is, of course, far from binding on any justices."" A quote by Kant used by the author of the NY Times article: ""The legislator may indeed err in judging whether or not the measures he adopts are prudent, but not in deciding whether or not the law harmonises with the principle of right. For he has ready to hand as an infallible a priori standard..."" The point here by Kant seems to be that we may disagree on whether the outcomes of policies are desirable or not from a utilitarian perspective (economists may disagree with each other and a supreme court justice may disagree with herself!) but it's hard for anyone to disagree that, paraphrasing Clarence Thomas's words, a priori or strictly speaking, a race-based policy is a race-based policy, ""pure and simple."" The pure principle is what Kant points at.

Another rebuttal still exists in what the author's students' said: what should be done about the denial of freedom and equality to African Americans? Kant is in the [retribution](https://iep.utm.edu/punishme/) camp. The question of how one would retributively ""enslave"" the present-day descendants of slave owners is quite a question. The closest thing to that that modern people would entertain is probably that the descendants of slave owners pay reparations to the descendants of slaves (and also the same thing with beneficiaries and survivors and their respective descendants of Jim Crow laws). If this is to be applied to the affirmative action arena, then it would be that the descendants of slave owners and the beneficiaries/descendants of Jim Crow laws are disadvantaged in the college admissions process and the descendants of slaves and victims/descendants of Jim Crow laws get their emptied seats. One sees the particular power in the evidence of the 2023 SFFA v. Harvard case since it showed that universities didn't do this and instead disadvantaged an ethnic group that is not part of the reparations debate. It's as if they did exactly what a deontologist would warn against - you can't trust people with the power to decide what's the utilitarian choice. If you give them that power then at some point in the future they'll misuse it or cause something unintended.

But it makes legal sense that universities' affirmative action policies didn't follow a retributive or reparations model as that was already struck down way back by the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke case, which declared that affirmative action can only be done for the now ubiquitously known purpose of diversity. (I don't have a source but apparently this notion of diversity was unknown to the public consciousness before the Bakke case.) Universities are in the business of educating students. Thus, they could use racial preferences to create a student body that they believed would create a better educational environment for students. The article brings this up saying, ""if affirmative action is to be defended, it must be on the basis of a pedagogical goal it directly furthers."" On this, I don't know what Kant would say. If a university's mission is to find the academically best students, that seems to be a no to affirmative action. If a university's mission is to create the best educational environment for students and diversity is deemed to be part of that, that seems to be an ok to affirmative action. I don't even know if a university's mission would be considered a moral thing to Kant. Perhaps the distinction between public institutions (plus private institutions receiving public funds) and private institutions is important here, too, since it is to invoking Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (the text of which says it applies to institutions receiving federal funding) and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment (the text of which says it applies to state actors). Would the mission of a public institution enter the moral realm while the mission of a private institution not so much? (In other words, are there policies or missions that Kant would allow private institutions to have that he wouldn't allow public institutions to have?)

The author concludes by describing how he was always on the side supporting affirmative action but lately was unsure of his own position, swayed by originalism or textualism (both closer to Kant) instead of a living constitution (closer to utilitarianism).

Something one encounters in Philosophy 101 like utilitarianism vs. Kant can indeed be applied to something as modern, ubiquitous, and hot as a topic as affirmative action.",t5_2qh5b
jshv6fs,t1_jq6xgmw,dasheea,1689709982.0,,"Replying in an old thread.

My guess is that /u/gammison means that if SFFA publicly declared that their mission was to get more white people into colleges by litigating against affirmative action, that would be racist-seeming. But instead, by championing Asian-Americans and highlighting the disadvantage they have in admissions, SFFA is less racist-seeming. I don't disagree with the logic there. Although the way I see it, justice for Asian-Americans is justice, whether it's bankrolled by someone called Edward Blum or someone called Bernard Sanders.

>Although if nobody was discriminated against by race via the listing of race on applications, then I suppose it wouldn't matter whether race was listed or not, so the ruling won't make much difference?

Yes (to your logic). The diversity that colleges are hung up on is racial diversity, so it mattered to them, which was why they wanted those boxes on the application for people to check. Now that it won't be on the application, if they follow the Supreme Court's rules - at least theoretically - colleges won't discriminate using race and the ruling will change the racial makeup of incoming student bodies compared to before.

>Defendants had a Berkeley economist tear that analysis apart, claiming that the Duke economist excluded analyzing applications from a sizable percentage of the applicant pool,

Although the Berkeley economist, David Card, is a Nobel prize-winning economist, curiously a lot of discussions I've found on the internet among econ people is that Card's analysis is not to be trusted and the Duke economist, Peter Arcidiacono's analysis is much better. I didn't know what to expect before googling about their standoff and was really surprised at how one-sided a lot of the econ discussions were (and I don't mean political discussion by econ people. It was focused on the economics and statistics).

Arcidiacono excluded applications that were ALDCs (Athletes, Legacies, Dean's interest list, Children of donors) because they are likely to be evaluated by the admissions office in a very different way from non-ALDCs. From [Slate magazine:](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/harvard-affirmative-action-case-legacies-athletes-aldc.html)

>ALDCs make up only 5 percent of applicants but 30 percent of the admitted class. They enjoy an admission rate of about 45 percent, as opposed to the normal rate of 4.5 to 5 percent, and account for more than 40 percent of the white student population.

The goal of someone in Arcidiacono or Card's position here should be to isolate the racial preference variable that is affecting applicants' admissions. That racial preference surfaces the most when we are talking about whom competitive non-ALDC Asian-American applicants are competing against in the admissions game. So for example, to investigate the argument that Asian-Americans are racially discriminated against even compared to whites, you want to compare non-ALDC Asian-Americans and non-ALDC whites. When you include in the data ALDCs, who are predominantly white and are in a sense ""uber-competitive"" (because they are uber attractive to Harvard admissions policies), the ability to isolate the above-mentioned racial preference in the analysis weakens. The more data you include where the admissions office is unlikely to be using that racial preference for non-Asian-Americans in their decision, the more you bury that racial preference within the data.

The example on the other side is if you include non-competitive applicants in your data. Including applicants who objectively had no chance of getting into Harvard (who score super low on Harvard's academic and extracurricular ratings, for example) in the data would similarly bury the racial preference being used. Imagine a data set that consists of 2 Asian-Americans with stellar applications that you reject and 2 non-Asian-Americans with good applications you admit and 30 other applications of any race with bad applications that you reject without even looking at what race they are because you know that those applications just have no chance of getting in. You've buried the racial preference within a sea of unrelated noise in the data. In Arcidiacano's own words, from page 17 of his rebuttal report:

>Professor Card’s models operate to conceal these racial penalties and preferences by diminishing their magnitude. One of the principal ways Professor Card’s models do so is by his inclusion of applicants who are not impacted by Harvard’s racial penalties and preferences. The inclusion of such applicants has the practical effect of making these penalties and preferences appear to be of smaller magnitude than they actually are. (To put it in simple terms, it is akin to reducing the value of a fraction by substantially increasing the size of its denominator.)

&#x200B;

>personal essays, and letters of recommendation from teachers and guidance counselors and when that was taken into account, no statistically significant difference in personal scores compared to white students was evident. They argued he cherry picked data and p-hacked essentially.

My understanding is that Arcidiacono ""leaves out"" those variables in his analysis in order to test if racial preference is being used in precisely those variables. When you ""include"" those variables, the data ""makes sense"" but it's precisely those variables (or rather, how the admissions office uses those variables to come up with the personal rating) that may be tainted by racial preference.

To put it in plainer words, if Asian-Americans have excellent academics and extracurriculars (as well as excellent alumni interviewer personal ratings, by the way) but aren't accepted at the same rate as other applicants with similar academics, extracurriculars, and interviewer ratings, then what is it that drags Asian-Americans down? Ok, so following the data, it's the missing variable, the personal ratings given by the admissions officers (which are derived from their reading of essays and recommendations) that drag them down. So there is coincidence (no causation proved, probably) between a race being dragged down by personal ratings and those personal ratings being the most subjective rating given by officers (who by the way have never met the applicant and are incentivized to create a racially diverse student body). That coincidence is what is being searched in the analysis by Arcidiacono. But if you start out with all the other variables included, you end up saying: if Asian-Americans have excellent academics, extracurriculars, interviewer reports, and so-so personal ratings and the data says these Asian-Americans 1. are admitted at a lower rate than other races with similar applications but better personal ratings and 2. are admitted at the same rate as other races with similar applications and similar personal ratings, then nothing isn't accounted for and no racial preference variable was found in the data! Arcidiacono purposely ""leaves out"" those variables to actually focus on those very variables to see if they are the sinister variables that are a cover for racial preferences.

>The supreme court made no determination as to who was correct, and instead used a ridiculous interpretation of the 14th amendment to kill affirmative action. They sidestepped the actual case because they wanted to kill AA.

My understanding is that there is some technical wrangling even among specialists (outside of the Supreme court) over whether the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment says anything definitive about affirmative action. ([Harvard Crimson article talking about some of it in its second paragraph.](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/analyzing-affirmative-action/article/2021/3/8/sharma-morality-and-legality/))  There is less of that wrangling among the specialists about whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 says anything about it - my understanding is that these specialists believe it does not favor affirmative action:

>No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

Apparently, in their opinions, Roberts brought up the 14th Amendment but Gorsuch brought up Title VI.

>The concrete data we do have about when AA is done away with (California, and Texas in the late 90s) is a massive increase in the white student population, and a decrease in first generation and POC students.

He seems incredibly out of touch with how Asian Americans feel nowadays, and more interested in pushing Fresh Off The Boat, than objectively covering Asian American issues as a Journalist.  Jay Kaspian Kang, Danny Chau, Donnie Kwak, Wesley Yang, all seem to have more fresh perspectives connected to how Asian Americans feel.  Oddly, Asian Americans journalists like Jay Kaspian Kang who have made an attempt to portray the perspective of often silenced, often immigrant or working class Asians have been attacked via Twitter from those in media/academia.   Those who go on the attack clearly have their own interests,  but the irony is these people accuse the Republicans for using Asians as a ""wedge"", when they freely use Asian politics as a tool to further their own agenda.  The difference is with Republicans, the argument economically makes sense from an objective perspect (Asians benefit with a higher % in higher education), whereas the Asian American mainstream media/academics will make these weird nonsensical racial arguments about ""wedge"" politics that in turn contradict their own arguments.  

There are Asian American journalists that represent both sides of Asian American politics fairly, without furthering a weird narrative or pitting Asian interests below or against those of other demographics.  For Jeff Yang, doing so has come to the point where it's not just some odd coincidence, it's become habit  - affirmative action being  a good example and most recently the controversy around Andrew Yang.

He was also  late to covering Yang's campaign.  For example, non-journalists like the Fung Bros had covered him much earlier.

If we made race illegal to list on an application, it would be impossible to discriminate against the black test-taker because nobody on the admissions committee would even know he was black.

However, if we did that, there would be a lower percentage of black applicants admitted because the current paradigm is that black applicants are, all other stats, scores, and extracurriculars being equal, **more** likely to be admitted to a law school than applicants of any other race.

Proponents of affirmative action believe this is fair, because being black also correlates with many statistics that suggest a lower chance of being admitted, such as lower test scores and lower average family wealth. (most of these due to no fault of the black applicant, but historical discrimination)

That's why proponents of affirmative action don't support race-blind admissions - it would result in fewer black applicants being admitted, because their race would no longer be considered as a positive characteristic of their application.",t5_2rfxx

i can't speak for all asian-americans, either. here, i'm mostly talking about experiences i've heard from chinese-american wechat groups, especially those more geared towards my parents' generation (i.e. people in their 40s-60s). if this comes off as harsh, i apologize; i'm a little upset over these events and i'm less inclined to phrase things carefully.

we have a lot of distrust towards other races, too; heck, we have a lot of distrust towards other asians. the concept of 'poc solidarity' is something that's roughly unheard-of within older generations because what's there to have solidarity about? most of the hot-button racial issues in america seem to exclusively view race relations as a white vs. black issue. others - affirmative action is a common example here - seem to uplift other minorities at the expense of asians.

so to us, it feels the same way: 'other races hate us until individuals prove otherwise.' it's only gotten worse recently because of recent events like covid-related hate crimes and blm-related looting (which unfortunately hit a lot of asian-owned businesses). some of that is because chinese-language social media (i.e. wechat) has been more on a political/fearmongering bent recently, but some of it is also because of the staggering lack of support from anyone outside our own communities. when asian people talked about covid hate crimes, they were told to shut up because police brutality was more important and our issues were just a distraction. when asian people talked about black-on-asian crime, we were told we should reflect on anti-blackness in our community first.

so yeah, i think a lot of us are scared. i think black people bear the brunt of this fear for a lot of reasons. some of it is simply fear of crime or violence; i used to live in LA and many older folks still remember the LA race riots. some of it is resentment, because it feels like we're expected to support black people but black people aren't expected to support us. some of it is just plain racism. can't deny that part.

i don't know where we go from here, honestly. it's a self-perpetuating cycle of blame, that's for sure. i think it helps to have these conversations so everyone can understand what each side's perspective is, and perhaps that'll help bridge the divide between us - we all just want some respect, after all. but as long as people still think of it as 'us vs. them,' it's going to be hard to break this mutual distrust.

anyways, once again - thank you for this response. it's a really respectful one and i really appreciate it; i've been pretty upset over these issues recently and your response helped remind me to move past my own knee-jerk reactions and seek to understand more of the root causes behind what's been happening. i hope my response gives you an idea of how some of the asian-american community feels, too.",t5_2qjyy

>How are Asian students like me supposed to get a top-tier education if no matter how good we do, we are capped to 15%?

I think this is a strawman argument. Has the UC said that this would happen? Fairly certain it hasn't. Cal's situation is like CalTech's, where Asian-Americans are overrepresented roughly 8-fold relative to actual US demographics. At worst for underrepresented groups, if the total Asian-American population drops a little from ~40% of the student population to help with equitable representation commensurate with the national population breakdown, I think that's a net win for the student body which will benefit from experiencing a more diverse environment.

If some bad shit happens to you because of race, do you really think it’ll get widespread attention? If you push an Asian heritage week onto your company will they be down to consider it? I don’t know about you but the idea of our success cancelling out or otherwise invalidating our voice seems to be quite prevalent. And with Americans increasingly unable to differentiate between Asian Americans and China, it feels more and more important to bring this up.

Dude, this is a huge set of strawmen arguments. You're twisting my words when you bring up a ""whose got it worse competition"", and nothing I said precludes any of your points. For the sake of discussion, though, I'll play: 

1) at least in academic STEM where I work, Asians are fairly well represented in the work force; our percentages match the national demographic even when you only account for Asian Americans strictly. Asians are most likely overrepresented once you factor in foreign Asian populations. I recognize business is a whole 'nother ballgame, as well as in leadership, hence the bamboo ceiling reference. 

2) Given the coverage of anti-asian racism during the pandemic, I actually do feel anti-asian discrimination would get widespread attention. Maybe that's because I'm more tuned in because I have skin in the game, though.

3) Diversity is one of the stated values at my research institution and we have multiple events recognizing Asian heritage, including a Lunar New Year festival. I recognize I'm super fortunate in this regard, and that there are parts of the USA where this would be scoffed at, but it is progress.  

4) *This is the most important point*: I never said nor implied Asian success cancels out Asian voices in the minority debate, or that we shouldn't stand on the same side as other minorities. I was merely trying to point out that we (Asian Americans) have to be aware of when certain issues apply to us, [edit] and that certain Asian groups are more privileged in some respects. Eg., when the University of California decides to reinstitute affirmative action, Asian Americans as a whole can't say, ""what about us, we're minorities, too,"" but instead we should recognize that, when disaggregated, some Asian groups are still overrepresented, but other groups like Southeast Asians are underrepresented and deserve to have a voice at that table.",t5_2qh3l

If so I believe you need to clarify as such and edit your original post. In the US blood quantum admission criteria relates to only a few colleges and universities that sit on the former sovereign lands of specific Native American tribes. Such policies are specifically about reparations, not affirmative action. Other colleges and universities may request that Native American applicants produce such documents certifying blood quantum not for admission purposes but rather financial aid. There are colleges and universities that have endowed grant and scholarship funds that they are the custodians of that have such requirements. 

Second, we need to identify what affirmative action is and isn't. Affirmative action policies and programs are those where race/ethnicity is the causal factor. For example colleges and universities with racial/ethnic quotas, or use a point system where points for minority races/ethnicities still determine the outcome are to be considered as affirmative action.  

Diversity programs and policies where race/ethnicity and test scores are just two factors among many are not on face value to be considered affirmative action. One needs to have causal evidence that race/ethnicity is still the sole or primary factor. We need to remember here that correlation is also not causation. Accusing such diversity programs as being ones of affirmative action without any evidence other than causal qualitative observations is inappropriate and only works to confuse people and digress into unnecessary discussions.

Simply put, affirmative action is when race/ethnicity is the causal factor. Diversity programs with a racial/ethnic bias, but where race/ethnicity is not the causal factor, not affirmative action.

With all of that being said, I don't support affirmative action. I believe that race/ethnicity should never alone be used to determine admissions whether it is a clearly defined policy or as a de facto practice. Thankfully though, overwhelming evidence suggests that no college or university engages in affirmative action as I have defined it. There have been attempts to do so, such as with Harvard and admission of Asian applicants. But again, the evidence in the case overwhelming suggests otherwise.

The question is quite open-ended and most people including myself would interpret it as including stuff like resource/outreach programs (i.e access to books, tutoring, mentoring, misc college admissions resources, etc.) 

In contrast, a Survey USA [poll](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d15fdb0d-701d-495c-a67f-e17bfcc3bf92) is worded more specifically:

> ""The next statewide ballot measure, Proposition 16, would allow diversity to be considered as a factor in public employment, education, and contracting decisions. Are you ...?""

In response to this, 35% of Asians stated they're certain to vote Yes, 42% stated they're certain to vote No, and 23% were unsure.

In other words, Asians are quite supportive of affirmative action when you present it in more vague terms, but once you specify that it means considering their race in college admissions (like in Prop 16 which was endorsed by Ds and opposed by Rs) people become much more hesitant.

Polls like the one you linked are essentially used to push a pro affirmative action agenda, because there's a massive disconnect between the question's wording and the reality of what affirmative action would entail if people voted for it (i.e Prop 16).

1619 Project being taught in high schools, and the fact that CNN/NYT/etc. generally act like there's nothing wrong with it from an educational perspective. 1619 has been criticized by numerous scholars including liberals like John McWhorter. It's been heavily critiqued by the World Socialist Web Site which has numerous articles from historians/scholars on its various factual inaccuracies. And obviously right-wingers are criticizing it too.

So let's just appreciate for a moment how we have straight-up Trotskyists, American conservatives, and some American liberals like McWhorter all united in criticizing 1619 (albeit, for different reasons). And despite all this, it's still being taught in high schools while various left-wing media outlets continue to act like it's only ignorant/racist white conservatives who have a problem with it.

---

I agree that ""teaching kids to hate America"" is an exaggeration, but it's worth pointing out we had people on the San Francisco BoE trying to rename a bunch of public schools, including ones named after Lincoln and Washington. Stuff like this just fuels conservatives' confirmation bias, and to me, it shows right-wingers weren't completely wrong when they claimed ""they'll be coming after Washington next"".

I understand that Washington and Lincoln tend to be idealized despite being far from perfect, but I would hope their overall legacies are considered positive enough as to not warrant their names unworthy of honor.

Fortunately, the mayor of SF and a bunch of other people called out the Board, and there's a recall effort which will hopefully be successful.

Worth mentioning at least one lady on the Board (Alison Collins) has tweeted some extremely offensive things about Asians, which is ironic considering she and other board members see themselves as anti-racist crusaders. This isn't just about Collins being racist, this is about how the ""anti-racist"" worldview *helps people mentally justify their racism as anti-racism*. And so I just really hope our kids aren't being taught this trash at school, ever. I've heard about Ibram X Kendi being paid to speak at various high schools so who knows how many teachers are having their kids read his book.

People like Kendi or the SF BoE members having such an influence/presence in education is something I find extremely concerning. How many kids are being taught, either directly or indirectly, that the worldview those people espouse is the correct one?

---

In closing, I'll mention that I still vote Democrat for various reasons that aren't related to the current subject. But I do think it's really annoying how various left-wing media outlets handwave these concerns as if it's only ""dumb Trumpers"" who have a problem with this stuff.",t5_2s6h3

Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.
Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.
Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.""

Why do you think all of these anti affirmitive action lawsuits are being organized by white conservative lawyers?  Do you think that with many top universities having sometimes close to a 30-40% Asian population, that if these lawyers managed to have Affirmitive Action overturned that they would switch to a pure test score / gpa system?  If they did that the Asian percentage would go up even more and the white percentage will drop even more.  They would never do that.  Overturning Affirmitive Action will allow them start adding metrics like leadership and other coded language to allow universities to discriminate on their own terms, and not have to worry about whether their policy ends up discriminating based on race.

If they cared about meritocracy why do these attorneys stay silent about legacies, which is white affirmitive action?  The reason is because this is what they want the system to actually be, to allow every university to have the power to discriminate based on finances, based on connections, based on the discretion of university admission boards, that are wholly made up of wealthier white people.

I understand that Affirmitive Action has negative implications, though you are way overrating how much an effect it has, look at the actual numbers, it's not very likely that an Asian American is going to lose a spot to a black or latino student, youre way more likely to lose the spot due to a lesser qualified white student.  That's just basic statistics, white people are under-represented at top universities due to Asian enrollment, and make up a much bigger chunk of the applicant pool.

The point is, you can be against Affirmitive Action, but dont be a pawn for these conservatives, they're just using your outrage as an asset to achieve their means, but I guarantee you that they view Asian Americans as a threat to the white hegemony, and whatever system that replaces Affirmative Action will not be good for Asian Americans.",t5_3amv4

Here is some reality about Affirmitive Action, as it currently exists it helps WHITE people too.  If you an Asian-American loses a spot due to Affirmitive Action, guess who is most likely to get that spot?  A white person, because 

1. many universities, because there are so many Asians, white people are under-represented.  
2. way more white people are applying to universities than black and latino students (part of why their acceptance rate is much higher).
3. the problem is so obvious that under a pure test & gpa system that Asians would take up even more slots, much more than black and latinos would lose spots, so it would hurt white people overall.

Imagine if we created black privilege training sessions that focused on telling people that Asians deserved more and black people need to check their privilege and unconscious biases towards Asians because they have worse hardships including immigration struggles. These kind of sessions are useless and literally no one comes out of it thinking anything besides what a waste of time ime",t5_2thqg
dvw48kh,t3_85b77h,Babycorgz,1521381958.0,,"So Caltech does not practice affirmative action or atheltics recruiting. That, plus the fact that Caltech looks for excellence in STEM explains why you see a high correlation between admits and high SAT scores.

To my understanding, Caltech is really the only private school that practices this admission policy. 

That being said, correlation doesn't mean causation. You cannot get in with just great scores alone. I think stronger STEM extracurriculars is always better than strong test scores.

14m3otf,,OkWolf53651,1688041577.0,,"Is there a single Asian American advocacy group that doesn't spend money on supporting affirmative action? I am somewhat agnostic on the issue of affirmative action as it affects blacks and Hispanics, but it is insane for Asian Americans to support it in its current form, where even [whites get a 140 SAT bump compared to Asians](https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/standardized-tests-hurt#:~:text=A%20National%20Study%20of%20College,points%20higher%20than%20African%20Americans). Yet every Asian American advocacy group I could find supports affirmative action full stop.

For example, ""Stop AAPI Hate"" is organized by CAA, [Chinese for Affirmative Action](https://caasf.org/stop-aapi-hate/). Not only do these motherfuckers support policies that discriminate against Asians, apparently they support it so much that they have to name themselves after it. This is especially pathetic when [only 39% of California Asian Americans supported affirmative action in the last proposition](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/11/us/supreme-court-affirmative-action.html) (still way too high). Even only 55% of Hispanics supported it and they directly benefit from it.

A few other groups I looked into also support AA. Like the NYC based Asian American Federation, which was involved in an [amicus brief supporting AA](https://www.aaldef.org/press-release/aaldef-files-amicus-brief-in-supreme-court-on-behalf-of-121-asian-american-groups-and-educators-in-support-of-race-conscious-admissions-at-harvard/) along with many other Asian groups. Also kinda weird how they don't have [female dominant the staff is](https://www.aafederation.org/about-us/) (though they do have male board members and maybe Asian guys are just less likely to get involved?)...no further comment on this one.

Even if you bizarrely support AA, *why is that the job of an Asian American advocacy group*? If some black people somehow supported keeping down the number of black actors (they are actually overrepresented on TV by now, though maybe not considering most shows take place in cities that have more black people), do you think BLM would ever take up that cause?

My idea for looking for a group is so that I can donate, maybe actually get involved, and stop doomscrolling. But I can't find any. Does anyone know of one?",t5_30c2m

This is the kind of thing that's hard to find out if it's true though because people will be worried about sounding racist by reporting on it...

I don't know how you'd change it though. Ironically this is something where affirmative action probably would help - seeing more black doctors, for example, surely helps this specific problem in some way. If a kid thinks they have a realistic shot of becoming a doctor, they will surely get into way less trouble because they have much more to lose.
