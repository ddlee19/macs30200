Because sometimes unquantifiable achievements trump stat scores. Even when the stats scores aren't equal. 

Example: recruited athlete has 2000 on SAT scores and 3.2 GPA. But is is All-star and MVP 3 years in a row in -insertwhatever sport- as a, let's say, goalie. Is also Hispanic. 

White person has a 2300 SAT score with 4.3 average. And was class president 3 years in a row. 

Prestigious college's sports team had their goalie graduate the previous year and had no second string currently on their roster. Person A was accepted. Was it because he was Hispanic? Or was it because he was a asset that the college wanted? And is this unfair to the white guy?

Here's another example. Emma Watson applies for Brown. Straight A student. Highest marks on A-levels. Another English student with all the same academic scores applies to Brown also. Gets rejected. Was Emma Watson accepted because she had great Stats or because she was Emma Watson? 

I'm not saying that the unquantifiable checkboxes of **All** Asians aren't up to par, but the ones who didn't get in, there is probably a reason why you didn't get in (someone out-awesomed you). 

And that's the thing with affirmative action. Affirmative Action was put into place because there was an under representation of minorities at Harvard. They made it a priority to look into recruiting more POC to bring diversity into their school. And other schools followed in their footsteps. Affirmative Action never said that their priority was to only admit this and that percentage of this or that race. It's only to says that race is a contributing factor to admissions.  

So you are supporting the dismantle of a program that helps disadvantaged kids because it help other races more. Period. That's your argument. We can debate all day about the nuisances of your stance, but that is the stance that you and Blum, at its core, believe is right. I disagree. 

Also you're going up against the University that created and basically birthed Affirmative Action. Also it's one of the top law schools in the country... so good luck with that. 

There's a reason why AA advocacy group are publicly denouncing this court case and why an conservative advocate, Blum (who also btw is trying to repeal certain parts of the Jim Crow law and that it's the foundation for the new legislation for voter ID laws) is the using this as a vehicle for taking down Affirmative Action.

White speaker's point of view: anti-discrimination policies and laws are to help and protect those at the bottom, and helps African-Americans and Native Americans. 

Asian speaker's point of view: race based admission criteria are hurting Asian-Americans. 

Edit: After rethinking about it, I think what happened was that the group invited both to have a debate about affirmative action. The white speaker was suppose to be defending affirmative action, while the asian speaker was acting as the one against affirmative action. However, the asian speaker conditioned his argument so that it ONLY appealed to Asians only, and ONLY focused on arguing against the race factor of affirmative action. All the asian speaker's examples were based on Asians. The white speaker easily deflected throughout the debate, as he simply questioned the asian speaker, what then should the criteria's be? Which the asian speaker was unable to give a direct answer. **(in debate, you have to establish rules and guidelines as a base, then you can debate upon affirmative action)**. After that, the white speaker simply said affirmative action should be allowed to stay because America had a history of social segregation, and those affected, (especially in states such as texas, where there used to be segregation), should be helped by affirmative action. (In contrast, states that do not have a history of government imposed racial segregation, such as california, does not use affirmative action). 

My personal thoughts are that the Asian speaker was too focused on the race part of affirmative action and conditioned his whole argument around the fact that affirmative action is race based, and thus hurts asians. As the one arguing against it, the asian speaker has the burden of going on the offensive. He didn't even establish criterias (very important in a debate!!) when asked what criterias a school should use and kept on saying he is not trying to impose the criteria that schools should use (amateur mistake!). It's a debate, set the rules and criterias, and then we can all debate about affirmative action under those set rules. ",t5_3amv4
dvoiv0x,t3_84bir8,King-Peasant,1521029978.0,,"First off, this is not an actual debate (does not follow competitive debate format and the two sides are not opposing), it is more of a discussion. It was weird listening to this because the Asian speaker presented this as a debate, while the white speaker did not. This could be a strategy by the white speaker, or this could simply be because group that invited him did not tell the white speaker he should argue for affirmative action.

I'll summarize in a neutral way and easy to understand way what was going on: 

Round 1  
(Speaker 1 Asian) argues against the use of using race as a factor in determining college admission
(Speaker 1 Asian): Colleges tell you self-identify race, and based on race, they can have certain representations, allowing for over and under representation of different races. Whites are under-represented. Asians are over-represented. You are compared to other of your race. These policies have a negative effect on Asian-Americans. Colleges say they use these policies to help groups that are disadvantaged. Speaker 1 brings up the counter-point to use actual disadvantages of individuals instead of using racial groups. 
(Speaker 1 Asian): Colleges say they look at the whole package, not just SAT scores and grades. Speaker 1 brings up the argument that this is simply not true because this happens year over year. And clearly, Asians can't be lacking in leadership skills, extracurricular activities every single year over many years. Speaker 1 says this part of the discrimination. 

(Speaker 1 White) does not argue for the use of race, nor does he argue for the use of affirmative action. He brings up more questions to help us question what criteria should be used. A few examples of past reasons for admission criteria was that diversity is for rectifying past social injustices. Diversity admissions also try to find people from all over the US, places that have high such as Alaska will unconsciously have more whites, so there is no direct discrimination [of trying to limit the amount of Asians]. He lists a few more other examples, but he does not argue for the use of race, nor does he argue for the use of affirmative action.  

Round 2  
(Speaker 1 Asian) agrees that it is hard to determine what admission criteria should be. He continues to argue that race should not be used. And brings up the point that there is race based harm. He brings up more examples that many white-passing mixed races try not to be Asian, including not playing the piano, not taking any chinese classes, just so he would not be associated with being an Asian. He concludes that he is not trying to say what admission criteria should be, but arguing that race should not be part of it. 

(Speaker 1 White) brings up history, and says the supreme court predicted that affirmative action [helping African Americans and Native Americans] would eventually be hurting others. But he also says he is confident in defending affirmative action to help African Americans and Native Americans. However, he says he is less confident when talking about Asians being discriminated because this argument [of Asian's being discriminated] completely ignores history [America's past history of discrimination].

dv46zlq,t3_81n24n,King-Peasant,1520074961.0,,"Here's an honest opinion of a someone who recently joined this sub last week. 

The difference I noticed between /r/asianamerican  and /r/aznidentity is that aa is more of a forum for talking about aa subjects. Aznidentity is more of an activist sub. 

Like all activist subs, many members are extremely passionate about furthering the rights of the group. I have no problem with people being extremely passionate. I just hope that there would be more education instead of name shouting. Like many activist subs, the motto, ""if you're not with us, you're against us"" holds true for this sub as well. I was called a inner-racist for disagreeing, whatever that means, and perhaps I'm not the most vocal and emotion fueled person, but I don't think anyone likes a discussion becoming a name shouting fest. 

I'm an old school guy, and my parents taught me to ignore the problems and cope with them. The newer generation of Asians seem to be more of a ""fight for your right"" type. And I have no problems with this mentality. I do appreciate the learning experience as I learned that asians face ""contemporary discrimination"", holding back those at the top. Since, I think the public, and most of us old schoolers have an idea that discrimination and racism is more holding back those at the bottom. My parents just told me to cope with it, and living in Socal, I think the majority of us just ""coped"" with it. Of course, this is a completely different ideology as aznidentity is more about activism than ""coming to terms with reality"".  

Perhaps I'm too mellow since I'm living and working in Asia now, so I obviously don't directly face what most of the members of this sub is going through, but I am interested to see how far Asian activism will go. I'm not into the relationship type of stuff, so I won't comment on that, but as for the educational and job opportunities, I do appreciate that there is a group of people who are rising up and trying to change things. Back then, every Asian in socal just sort of, shrugged off things like affirmative action and job quotas, it seems that more and more people are speaking out.

Lol. I just fact checked on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_209). And the table they have doesn't seem to match your point. The only thing that is true is whites lost a lot more spots, and latinos gained more, while Asians have stayed relatively the same. 


> Asians bumped out of top spots bump all the other Asians down since Asians are not treated as individuals and instead compared with Asians (a violation of civil rights).

I think you meant [compared with non-Asians]. But seriously dude... bumping out other Asians? As if whites don't bump out other whites. And blacks don't out other blacks. Assuming you're serious and not trolling, in order to even prove a race is bumping out others from the same race, you would have to control everything from financial aid, admissions costs, grades, test scores. Heck, they would even have to pick the same exact schools. The only difference would be one has 20 more test points than the other. Just think about how silly your statement about bumping other Asians down is. You're also confusing how admissions work, they judge you both individually and collectively, you've been drinking too much cool-aid if you think they only judge you individually. 

> This argument is dishonest and reflects internalized racism. Where else do we tolerate discrimination against those that dream big?

And this is just silly. Internalized racism? Lol, this is the first time I heard this referred to me. What's happening to you man? You got so much hate in you, you can't get the racism out of your head that you even accuse your fellow Asian of internal racism. The better idea would be to apply for other schools instead of ONLY Ivy League schools. Because what college you go to is just the beginning. Ask any Asian if college or post-grad was more important and ill guarantee you, they'll all say post-grad. Dreaming big does not mean you have to get in an Ivy League school, and not getting in one, does not mean life is over. Dude, if I see you I'll give you a man-hug, no homo.


Edit: 

Here are the real numbers from [UC's website](http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/factsheets/2017/fall-2017-admissions-table3.pdf). 

In 2015, Asian-Americans were 36.3% (22,428) of all UC schools. In 2017, Asian-Americans were 34.2% (23,907) of all UC schools.  So while the total number of admitted increased, the percentage of Asian-Americans admitted actually decreased because there were more available spots. 

The numbers don't lie, and I think that should be enough to realize that even in places that don't practice affirmative action, the % of Asian-Americans acceptance rate will not increase. In fact, the numbers actually decrease across all UC schools. On the contrary, Latinos have gained the most. Representing 29.6% (18,280) in 2015, and 33.2% (23,209) in 2017. ",t5_3amv4
duwfiwk,t1_duwecta,King-Peasant,1519730211.0,,"The problem comes when fellow Asians start thinking they will be more successful if it is fully merit based. I think it's safe to say that all of us here want to better the lives of Asians in America. I just think as a group, we shouldn't focus on affirmative action, which only affects a very small group of people (like the kid who only got into 1 ivy instead of 3 or 4). Come on guys! Instead, we should focus on helping Asians as a whole. 

Will an Asian get a spot in Ivy league when he only scores 2000/2400 (93%ile, I know cause that's what I got) on the old SAT? What about 30/36 on the ACT (also what I got) Of course not, but he should have no problem getting into any other school, and there are many schools to pick from. The holistic approach gives Asians as a whole, just as much pros as it has cons. Asians who have worse placements aren't even trying to get into Ivy Leagues, with shitty average Asian scores like mine, I myself didn't even consider it). But there are enough top tier colleges in America, it shouldn't matter. 

Edit: (Not directed at who I'm replying to) Too many of you guys assume that if they remove affirmative action, the Ivy League spots given to affirmative action will instead of given to Asians. They'll just be given to legacy students or students that don't file financial aid, which will also be detrimental to Asians who come from poorer households. Too many of you guys also assume that getting into an Ivy League = success. That's so far from the truth. As an Asian who has finished university, in terms of monetary success, my advice for those who are entering colleges is that your major matters more than your college. A stem degree from an non-ivy school (but still should be top tier school), will net you a higher salary than a humanities degree from an ivy school. ",t5_3amv4
duw1h98,t3_80hbri,King-Peasant,1519703691.0,,"Serious talk here, affirmative action only talks about the highest of top tier universities. And from what I remember, they also have a diversity quota based on where you are located in. So you are also competing with students from where you live. If you live in an Asian majority place, you'll lose out if you are not top 5 from your school, doesn't matter how high your grade is (since everyone I knew has at minimum 3.5 unweighted, this was in 2008, who knows how crazy grade inflation is now). And the example in the video was horrible too, the kid got in 1 Ivy League and he says he feels discriminated just cause a black kid will get into more? smh.... at the end of the day, both kids can only pick 1 school. The rest is just ego and bragging rights. What about the backup schools this Asian kid picked?  

So what about the other top tier schools, like the UCs (UCs have an crazy over representation of Asians)? I lived in California and we have a merit based program (top 5% - 10%ile of your class is guaranteed a spot in UC, because we pay taxes to these schools). How come no one complains about the UC systems and only complains about the private Ivy Leagues? 

Come on you guys. The Ivy leagues are only a few schools out of the thousands of colleges. And this is only about high school to university, kid stuff. How about postgrad schools?  ",t5_3amv4
dulbtk8,t1_dul8qsq,King-Peasant,1519213247.0,,"Agree with you. And I'll add in that the ""Asian parent mentality"" is what people would call, measuring things objectively. 

Objective stats like grades, diplomas, legacy schools, translate to jobs in law, medicine, and stem. I think it's fair to say collectively as an Asian group, this portion is already pretty saturated and has an over representation of Asians. And it's a double sided sword, because while it allows Asians to be the top wage earners, it also encourages the model minority stereotype of the uncool, awkward, nerd who only likes to read books.  

Realistically, not every Asian is cut out for school. What Asians as a group need is for the creative and entertainment industry to accept Asian Americans. To give a bigger representation of Asians as a whole. Or for more Asians to try trade schools, eventually developing it into a business, like an entrepreneur. Like you said, changing affirmative action won't help this group at all. So is there even a solution for this? I don't know. The movie industry is like the most superficial industry ever, just look at how many white actresses sold out their bodies to an old pervert just for a gig. Heck, when my Asian brothers and sisters ask me for career advice, I myself point them towards the objective route because that's the road I took. But joining this sub, made me realize the problems Asian Americans face are more focused on the creative jobs like singing and acting, etc, since they are underrepresented. 

Maybe moving the conversation towards this way will help us as a collective refocus. Affirmative action only affects a very small percentage of Asians. Pretty much negligible. And let's be real, back when I was in college, I remember ""Americans of African-descent"" were calling bs on affirmative action because schools would choose a REAL ""African"" whose parents were Nigerian doctors, but were ""uneducated,"" poor taxi drivers in America.

Asians and Asian Americans care a lot about their children's education. The Korean Prime Minister and Korean Justice Minister were brought down over admissions scandals.  

It wasn't that long ago, that Asian Americans were a very solid bloc that voted Republican. In 1992, 55% Asian Americans voted for Bush vs 31% for Clinton.

Instead, I would point out that the AA going Democratic around the same time that states with large AA populations like California banned affirmative action with Prop 209. 

With no threat of affirmative action, the AA could vote Democratic on issues they agreed with the Dems without worrying that it would hurt their children's education.

When Harvard was facing that lawsuit about its admission practices and how that impacted its Asian applicants, Harvard would trot out Thang Diep, an Asian Harvard student, class of '19.

His academic rating was a 3+. 

His SAT Score was 2060, which is really good, but not that great for Harvard which would have placed him in the 25th percentile of the other members of the Harvard class of '19.

No, he was the president of his school's Key Club and an officer of his high school's student body. That's good, but usually you'd expect something more to get into Harvard.

So, what was his hook into getting into Harvard when other applicants, with much more impressive scores and credentials, didn't get in?

His admission file admired his 'struggle with his sexuality' and Thang Diep used to say that being gay is what probably helped him to get into Harvard.

Asian solidarity is an American idea, usually from white washed Asian Americans. I know some people won't like to hear this, but it's true. It is a dream to make up for lack of connection to roots. ""Asian"" is not really an identity, but a word of convenience. When you don't want to list one ethnicity after another.

True Asian solidarity only happens when done by those loyal to their own ethnicity/nationality. So for example, when various Asian ethnicities in the US teamed up on the issue of College admissions/affirmative action, that was a far more genuine example of solidarity than any of these activist buffoons claiming ""Asian American"" this and that.

Any future of Asian identity and solidarity must be done through our respective ethnicities. That is also the best way to secure against those with agendas from speaking for us under the guise of ""Asian Americans"".",t5_3amv4

> That Liang is Asian complicated the white cop/black victim paradigm. Other non-white police officers have been involved in high-profile killings – two of the six Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray are black, for example – but none have been claimed by their community the way that Liang has been claimed by Chinese Americans.

> “This is a story and a case that will go down in the history of New York and of race relations in the US,” said Cathy Dang, the executive director of CAAAV, a pan-Asian community group in New York that has been at the forefront of Asian American organizations opposing the pro-Liang movement. Dang and her allies see support for Liang as being driven by a desire for Chinese Americans to be treated as equal to whites in the racial hierarchy. 

> Min Liu, a first-generation immigrant living in a Silicon Valley suburb, explained the fear this inspires. “We are afraid we and our children will forever be the scapegoat,” she said. “The Chinese Exclusion Act was where we were scapegoated because the workers were not happy about their wages and job losses,” she said. When unarmed black men were shot, she added, “no police were indicted. The one rookie Chinese cop who had no intention to kill was the only one who was indicted and convicted. It was clear scapegoating to us.”

> “A lot of the coverage has described this [protest movement] as the Asian American community,” said Vincent Pan, the executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. “But I think that we need to be specific that this was the Chinese American community.”  More specifically, he said, the Liang case has largely become a rallying point for recent first-generation Chinese immigrants, rather than second- or third-generation Chinese Americans who were born and raised in the United States. To Pan, the current crop of first-generation Chinese immigrants are distinct from previous groups in that they are highly educated professionals, he says, who came to the US to attend college or start careers, rather than to go to work in a restaurant or garment factory. They are also significantly more connected to China than was previously possible. 

> But Kai Zhu, a first-generation Chinese immigrant and father of two, embraces the division – between his class of Chinese Americans and the working class, the second and third generations, and other people of color – and trumpets the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps values of “the old-fashioned meritocracy”. Zhu, who worked as an engineer in telecommunications until he became a lawyer, lives in one of Silicon Valley’s wealthiest suburbs, Los Altos. In addition to organizing pro-Liang protests – first in 2015 when the officer was indicted and again in 2016 after the conviction – Zhu helped recruit Gabriel “Jack” Chin, a professor of immigration and criminal law at the University of California Davis, to add some heft to Liang’s legal team. “I don’t think the second- or third-generation Asian or Chinese Americans really understand what is going on,” he said. “Because, to be perfectly honest, I think here in California all the young people are so liberal because they are so brainwashed by these public schools.”

> Smoot’s mother is fourth-generation Chinese American. Her father is fourth-generation Japanese American and white. Smoot speaks Cantonese because she attended immersion schools in San Francisco, not because her mother is a native speaker. “People were like, ‘You can’t be Chinese and not support [Liang]. You can’t have that position and still claim to be Chinese,’” Smoot said. “I thought it was important to be there to disrupt that solidarity in some way, or to try to redefine a different solidarity.” “It made me feel like I didn’t have a lot in common with these people after all.”

dlas3rn,t3_6s1aid,FeelMyEggRoll,1502137471.0,,"I'm going to address Point 2 of your post since the issue you raise is very important.

[To top 20 percent of income earners in America](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/08/dream-hoarders-1-percent-upper-middle-class) consist of the upper-middle class cognitive elite - i.e., people who work in media & publishing, IT, fashion & design, as well as professionals such as doctors, engineers, lawyers & accountants. 

Uncoincidentally, most of these people lean Liberal. And interestingly, Asian-Americans have become prominent in these professions.

Now let's look at 2 aspects of this:

**Immigration**
If Trump gets his way by making immigration to the U.S. a merit-based system (based on education, skills and English language ability), then immigration from North East Asian countries will likely accelerate. This Asian immigrant cognitive elite (and their children) will inevitably compete with upper-middle class White liberals and will threaten their place in America's socio-economic hierarchy. White liberals are understandably terrified of being flung into the lower rungs of the economic ladder like their Rustbelt ""white trash"" lower-middle class brethren (whom the white liberals hate).

Look at Canada, which has employed a merit-based immigration system since the 1970s. Canada's population is now **15% Asian**, and the North East Asian segment of that demographic (i.e., Chinese, Koreans, Japanese and to a certain extent, Vietnamese) are essentially Canada's cognitive elite. 

For example, if you take a stroll in downtown Toronto around Bay Street (Canada's version of Wall Street), about 25% of the faces you see are Asian. Ditto for Toronto's IT industry and fashion & design industry.

**Education**
Trump's Justice Department is investigating complaints of discrimination against Asian Americans through the practice of Affirmative Action at Harvard. If the end result of this investigation is that the application process will be strictly merit-based, Asian Americans will inevitably dominate university campuses throughout America, like they already do in the California university system.

And many white liberals are adamantly against banning Affirmative Action because they instinctively know this. AA is the only thing preventing the floodgates from opening for a tsunami of Asian-American students that will compete with the children of white liberals for spots in the best American universities.

Again - look at Canada, where Affirmative Action doesn't exist. [The best universities in Canada by world ranking are the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-canada). Asians dominate both campuses. The upper middle class white kids have to flee to Queens, Western or Wilfred Laurier to get an education as a result.

From my perspective, because Asians have such a large presence in Canada, there is less stigmatization against Asians (and Asian men) than the United States. 

So Trump might actually be a blessing in disguise for Asian-Americans. Who knows, America's demographics might end up changing so much that the United States may become another Asian outpost (like Canada is today).

I’m Asian and I can give some context on this. Other people have mentioned selective immigration and the fact that only highly educated Asians are allowed into the country in the first place. But there’s a lot more too. Some of the things I will mention apply to immigrants, some apply to Asia as a whole, some are East Asian specific. 

Asians in general are under much, much higher pressure than other people, from our families/culture but also from American society in general. You will rarely see Asian criminals because for an immigrant, committing crime comes with the extra threat of deportation. Before affirmative action was overturned, an Asian with average grades could not get into the same universities as their peers. Asians have much less generational wealth, like grandparents or parents who can support you financially if you mess up, so you better make it yourself if you don’t want to end up on the streets. Actually you won’t see Asians on the street because a lot would just get deported if they messed up that badly.

In terms of culture and history: Asians are a lot less politically active than most minorities because a lot of us come from countries where political dissidence was punished very heavily. In East Asia, since ancient times there was high socioeconomic disparity, but if you were poor you could get into higher status by becoming a scholar. There were a lot of famines for the poorer class, so a high emphasis on education was formed because if you failed the scholar entrance exam, you were basically condemning your family/village to starve. That culture still exists especially since older generations are poorer. Many first generation Asians work as poor convenience store/restaurant/laundromat workers, cleaners, etc. with no breaks because they have an intense pressure to give their children better opportunities, and their children have an intense pressure to give a better life to the parents that gave up so much for them. 

Asians probably have one of the worst mental illness and burnout rates, but are the least likely to seek help because of less support, higher consequences, cultural stigma, etc. Asians do mess up, even if you haven’t met them. Asians have the highest socioeconomic disparity out of any racial group in the US, both between ethnicities (refugee populations are a lot poorer for example) and within ethnicities, like Chinese. Chinatowns are in ghettos. 

These reasons are why it really bothers me when liberals talk about privilege but they associate Asians low crime rates, high education, etc. with privilege and call us white-adjacent. Being underprivileged means that you have to work twice as hard for the same result, or that you have a shittier time at the same socioeconomic level, and those absolutely apply to Asians. It also bothers me when people criticize Asian tiger mom parenting, culture etc. without addressing the pressures by American society that push immigrants to be that way.",t5_2w2s8
i6ott5r,t3_ueowzi,XXShigaXX,1651252739.0,Verified :illuminati:,"Hey, just want you to know you're definitely not alone in your experience. Asian Americans who go through what you've been through handle these issues in different ways. However way you choose to handle your identity is up to you, but it is so important to *never* let other people's opinions of you cause you to hate yourself for who you are or how you look. Let's start by not calling you a monster.

Some points that I especially want to emphasize because I think they're vital to learning to self love instead of self hate as an Asian in the West:

1. **Never let someone else tell you you're ugly because you're Asian.** There will always be white people and non-Asians who will say Asians aren't attractive, monolids are ugly, black hair is boring, etc. There's countless bullshit in the media that makes Asians seem inferior to every other race. There might also be other self-hating Asians who internalized this criticism and let it completely consume their identity. Don't fall into this trap. Learn to love yourself and embrace who you are. Being Asian is one of your greatest strengths. Look to Eastern media for positive representation of Asians. Make other Asian friends online and branch out of your White towns as you get older. 

2. **Don't ever seek validation from other people (especially white people) for happiness.** You will never find true happiness this way. At the end of the day, anyone who actually respects you will love you for who you are (and this especially goes for platonic relationships). You can only find happiness in yourself--it's your own reward to yourself that no one has authority to take from you. Don't try to find joy hoping for someone to approve of you. Find joy in things you do for yourself. Find joy in helping others and spreading happiness because you want to. 

3. **Embrace who you are.** This is the body you were given. Nothing in the world will change that. No amount of plastic surgery will modify your DNA. No amount of hair dyeing will ever stop your natural colors from showing. And that's OK. You can continue to hate who you are at your core, but if you truly want to feel happy and unbound by white society's expectations of you to chase whiteness, you need to be able to appreciate yourself. You currently have so many barriers you put up around yourself because you're on guard about wanting to be accepted by others, but you don't even accept yourself. You need to wash your hands of this mentality and start remembering that the only person you really need to find acceptance from is yourself.

4. **Being Asian is honestly fucking awesome.** Historically, Asians are incredible. Past to present. China's four great inventions: paper, printing press, gunpowder, compass. Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese/Filipino/etc. traditional clothing are all beautiful. Our music is rich. Our food is incredible and diverse. Our languages are beautiful and diverse. How we all look is still so diverse. Our cultures are powerfully family oriented, considerate and respectful of others, emphasize academics because it's good to be educated and progress the world with science. And if not academia, our arts are visually and musically incredible. Anime and manga are dope. JPop, CPop, Kpop are sick. Traditional Asian art, architecture, and music are absolutely beautiful. Chinese New Year is my favorite holiday of the year because of how it powerfully culminates our history to present day. Asians age beautifully and we'll look 40 when we're in our 60s. Non-Asians chase after our skincare, music, and culture for generations throughout all time periods and we still do it better than them. Let's also not forget that while the ""model minority"" concept is bullshit used by white people to make every other minority hate us, you should always remember Asian Americans do work twice or three times as hard as any other ethnicity in America and we are often academically or financially successful, despite being disadvantaged by affirmative action, poverty, and white people. 

Check out Kdramas, check out animes, check out Kpop, check out Asian made video games. It is so damn cool to be Asian and there are so many cool Asians around you. You just have to be open to learning more about them and letting your walls down. We're not cool because other people want to copy our ""style"" or ""aesthetic"". We're cool because this is how we are and don't need to conform to them to be successful. 

**Don't just try to learn to stop self-hating. Learn to actually be proud to be Asian.**",t5_3amv4
