146wgoj,,SteadfastEnd,1686496483.0,1∆,"CMV: It's perfectly fine for Harvard and other universities to discriminate against Asian applicants. The Supreme Court is scheduled to make a ruling within the next 3-4 weeks, and many are expecting it to rule against Harvard (in the upcoming *SFFA vs. Harvard* case) and strike down affirmative action to some extent.

The facts of the case are that Harvard is being accused of discriminating against Asian applicants in two ways: first, by requiring Asians to have a higher SAT score in order to be considered for admission (than other races) and secondly, by assigning a lower ""personality score"" to Asian applicants than other races.

Now, it's not ideal for Harvard to have to resort to such practices. But the alternative is that Harvard would wind up with a student body that's 40% Asian. How is that ideal, and how does that benefit other students or diversity as a whole?

Let's look at the University of California system for an example. Decades ago, Californian voters abolished race-conscious affirmative action via referendum. The result was that Asians shot way up in college admissions at the UCs while black, Hispanic and other students fell in representation. (If I recall correctly, universities like UCLA and Berkley became 30-40% Asian.)

Admissions is a zero-sum affair; every college has limited seats. You admit more of one race, and the other races must necessarily fall behind and be less represented. Given the benefits that diversity has to offer for student learners, how can a (hypothetical) Harvard student body of 40% Asians, 50% whites, and 10% all other races possibly be more beneficial for the learners (and society overall) than something like 15% Asians, 50% whites, and 35% everyone else?

It should also be pointed out that Asians are already way over-represented even **with** affirmative action (they are only 6% of America's population but are already represented at around 20% in the Ivy Leagues.) If anything, Asian students should be held to an even *tougher* standard than they currently are, so that their representation can plummet down to something more suitable like 10-12% (which would **still** be over-representation.)

So, how else is Harvard supposed to achieve a diverse student body **without** resorting to tactics like making Asian students score higher on the SAT than other racial groups? Bear in mind that many other racial groups, such as African-American students, suffer from growing up in poverty or dysfunctional families in a way that many Asian-American students do not.",t5_2w2s8
13wk4og,,SteadfastEnd,1685534098.0,,"Diversity and meritocracy are fundamentally incompatible with each other. America can only have one or the other. With the Asian students vs. Harvard case coming up for a decision in the Supreme Court in June - and the Court widely expected to rule against Harvard - there's an elephant in the room that is often ignored:

**One cannot have diversity and meritocracy at the same time. They are mutually contradictory.**

Historically, certain categories of people excel at certain things. If you practice meritocracy, you'll inevitably see those categories of people get over-represented. (Which is why the NBA is 80% black, for instance. There is never affirmative action in pro sports; it would be impossible to enact.)

If you practice diversity, then you must find some way to artificially suppress the high-achieving groups, and artificially boost the low-achieving groups, in order to achieve the desired diversity-mix of people. (Which is why you end up with Asian students being required to score 450 points higher on the SAT than black students in order to have the same chance of admission to the Ivy Leagues.)

This could change down the line, of course. If suddenly getting into the NBA became the No. 1 Asian focus or craze, you could certainly see the NBA becoming 40% Asian down the road or something like that. But as long as people and cultures have different priorities, values or focuses, there will always be big gaps in representation in any meritocratic system.",t5_2qx8j

To date, many discussions about the Harvard discrimination case (*SFFA v. Harvard*) seem to devolve into some combination of the following:

* Asian Americans are being used as a wedge (*legacy admissions is the* real *problem, Ed Blum is an ultra-conservative*)
* AsAms are doing fine (*Asians are already over-represented, Asians don't face the same discrimination as other minorities*)
* AsAms focus too much on college admissions (*it's misguided to equate Harvard with success, Asian parents give their kids too much pressure*)
* The conservative Court will likely strike down affirmative action

IMO, even if these interpretations are true, they ignore a core part of the case (discrimination) and take agency away from Asian Americans. Let alone a lot of these thoughts are based on an arbitrary assumption that all Asians should be lumped together simply because of their connection to a very large continent.

Conservative are happy to use us as the model minority / wedge against other groups, liberals are fine gaslighting us in order to protect affirmative action, Harvard seems to be in denial mode to maintain its reputation, and all are essentially indifferent toward what the implications are for Asians.

I'm adding this because it's part of the Affirmative Action debate. This is a bill that would ban legacy admissions. A legacy admission is someone whose parent or grandparent graduated from the college. Typically, at private schools, a ""legacy"" is given a little bit of an advantage in getting admitted into the school. This affects API people because we generally do not have legacy admits in our families.

Excerpt:  
A bill was introduced Wednesday in the New York Assembly and Senate  to bar public and private colleges in the state from offering either  legacy admissions preferences or early decision.

Colleges that violate the law would be fined 10 percent of the  tuition and fee revenue paid by enrolled freshmen the prior year. The  funds collected from the fines would go to low-income students in the  form of financial aid/scholarships.

The move comes after [Colorado lawmakers voted last year to bar public colleges](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2021/06/01/colorado-bars-public-colleges-using-legacy-admissions)  from using legacy preferences. In that case, only a few public colleges  used legacy admissions, and they did not oppose the change. There is [a similar bill on legacy admissions being considered in Connecticut](https://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-legacy-admissions-20220218-3k5bdv2wi5hy5ao7a5wdzj54xa-story.html), and it is being opposed by private colleges in that state.",t5_800zaq

Realistically, among AAPI, the ones best able to rise up to the top schools are the children of middle class and wealthy immigrants, or even international students establishing residency. So they could end up with a huge number of admits, and thus, squeeze out the less represented groups, that include SEA refugees, US colonized people, and SA poor.

The reason was that disproportionate Jewish academic prowess and success threatened the traditional White Anglo-Saxon Protestant power structure.

No doubt but we humans will always bring our biases to the table which results in all sorts of people ""less qualified"" getting hired/promoted and it's not just because of the color of their skin. 

First of all, AA applies to [federal contractors](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/hiring/affirmativeact) so private corporations that have their own AA plan is doing it voluntarily and will implement it how they see fit to  meet the needs of their company. Also, AA is inclusive of all ""**qualified** minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans.""

Additionally, ""an affirmative action program could also be required by a court as a remedy for [discrimination](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/whenisanaapneeded.aspx) or as a voluntary remedy for past patterns of discrimination.""

While AA is not a requirement for all companies, just about all of them must be an [equal opportunity employer](https://www.findlaw.com/smallbusiness/employment-law-and-human-resources/are-employers-required-to-have-affirmative-action-plans.html).  This means you're not required to hire minorities but you can't discriminate against them.

So these quotas that you mention is what a specific company's hiring practice is that they CHOSE to implement. If I were a hiring managers, I would use these quotas as a metric to consider when hiring.  Given both candidates are qualified, if there was no metric, you'd probably pick the one that you ""liked"" more.  With the metric, you may have to check your (biased) favoritism aside and pick the other candidate.

In theory, that's how I think it should work. Does it always turn out that way? Probably not but I don't think it's fair to completely dismiss it either.  It's also a good idea to learn why AA was even necessary.  [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/affirmative-action) has a quick explanation about it with past law suits against it as well.  It's an interesting read.  You can check it this [timeline](https://www.aaaed.org/aaaed/History_of_Affirmative_Action.asp), too.

My final thought is I agree with you that companies shouldn't hire based on race (or sex, sexual orientation, disability, religion and all that).  Nor should they choose less qualified people to meet quotas.  I also think companies shouldn't hire people based on nepotism, the good ol' boys club, or the best ass kisser.  The best candidate SHOULD be the one hired.  AA levels the playing field when our past was riddled with ""white affirmative action"" before EOE and AA even existed. Do/can companies get it wrong?

I understand that this point has been brought up before in the context of this debate, but I'm not being rhetorical here. Diversity is more than just education.

jw3k7yq,t1_jw3hh62,throwaway-rhombus,1691987243.0,,"The fact that scholarships exist for Asians at all is enough to show that even oppressed groups who seem like they're outperforming the average still deserve to get boosts/is proof that economic achievement doesn't automatically rule people out from getting help. Having them come from private foundations doesn't negate the cause because I'm trying to argue against how it seems like you're saying there should be no more help once economic (yet notably not all kinds of) equality is achieved. I'm saying why stop helping women? We (or at least some good people) haven't stopped helping Asians. I also think it would be nice if there were more state/university-sponsored scholarships for Asians (I think they exist but not in large enough numbers).

Once again, thinking about ""model minorities"" like Say Asians and Jewish people, they seem like they outperform white people, but there are still economic measures to help them. Partly because there are actually still lots of poor Asians and Jew but also that being economically successful does not negate their oppression in other parts of their lives. I would be happy to still help them even if is at the ""expense"" of the rest because honestly, it's still not a full correction, and I would rather help other historically oppressed groups more even if it comes at my expense.

If women are experiencing higher economic outcomes, it's still justified to help women because the experiences of women are so diverse. This is similar to how scholarships for Asians are still helpful because there are actually tons of poor Asians, especially Southeast Asians. But Asians, even East Asians, still face oppression that white people don't. So I don't mind helping out.

If we instituted a payment to make black people economically equal to white people, that still isn't the end of the story because they still face much more danger and discrimination being black. These other issues often undo or ""cancel out"" the economic ""aheadness"". At least helping them in one area of life can kinda help the other unfair parts of life suck less for lack of better wording. In a way, it's correcting for past economic inequality, too. It may be great that whites and Asians are economically performing equally, but look back at previous generations. Like black people or women, the generational wealth inherited by an Asian person is likely much less than a white person even if they are technically making the same amount now. There is a ""hidden"" economic inequality still. 

This data is also not showing that women and men are economically equal in every or most areas, just some. Regardless, women, Asians, Jews, blacks, etc, still face a ton more oppression even if they become economically equal, so I don't mind still helping them.

Basically, don't pull a ""we don't need to help the model minority"" here because it ignores all the other ways that a group can be oppressed. Economic equality is not the end all be all.

If you cannot tell, I am very pro-affirmative action as an Asian, even if it supposedly harms Asians, because I care more about righting other bigger wrongs. If women or black people are getting scholarships now, them not getting scholarships anymore wouldn't harm men or other races because it depends on whether men or other races even get into the university at all. It helps women but doesn't harm men. Women get a boost in STEM admissions because of historical underrepresentation and mistreatment in the field, but I don't think they get boosts in an ordinary situation. If you disagree, which you probably do, I respectfully don't see any point in arguing further.

I know that Reddit leans more white, higher-income, male, moderate/conservative as opposed to liberal, so I doubt anything in this comment section would really change. I certainly won't change my mind and will remain committed to helping other oppressed people even if it ""harms"" me because I'm not gonna pin all my possible failures on other people. I simply find new/other ways to succeed.

Ex: as an Asian who didn't get into an Ivy League school, it's no biggie. There are other opportunities, and I'm not gonna blame it on others. Just move on and find your own success. I'm happy to see people less fortunate than me succeed even if it means I'm not part of that success.",t5_2si92

jbes2d2,t1_jbd91sk,AnimeCiety,1678288284.0,,">I'm not quite following your objection. The point of the paper is that 3rd gen plus East Asians in the SF Bay Area are seen as closer to the culture of their white neighbors than their immigrant origin co-ethnic origin brethren. Note that they aren't being coded either as Hispanic or black -- there's something about ""white"" that describes standard American culture (and I'd argue because the majority of what you'd call the fully assimilated cultural Americans are white).

Here's where I think we need to be careful about mis-using ""white"" as American, particularly as America becomes less ""white"" both culturally and genetically.  So you mention that many East Asians in the Bay Area are slowly moving closer to the culture of their white neighbors - but what are their white neighbors?  They're culturally Californian more than just ""American white"".  That last part where you' talk about ""white"" = standard American culture is both not true but also a little belittling to the various diversity within regional Americans.  

If a 3rd Gen Chinese American no longer speaks Chinese at home but mostly speaks English and partakes in hobbies more white dominant like polo or lacrosse and thus becomes more ""white"" then are we to say that Bay Area Whites, particularly the younger gen, who mainstream things like Kpop / K Drama, Boba, Anime, are therefore LESS white than the white folks living in Alabama?  Are white Tennessee Americans some how more American (White) than white Californians?  I believe that white Americans in California consuming Asian culture doesn't make them less white, nor less American and Asian Americans consuming mainstream traditionally white hobbies doesn't make them white.  Instead, what's happening is American culture is morphing at a faster rate in California than places like Alabama or Tennessee.  I'd personally stay away from using White to equate to Asian Culture exports into the US, the only people I've heard that consistently from is really far left liberal types that believe Asians = White in terms of a racial categorization whereas POC = Black, Brown, Indigenous.  

&#x200B;

>A large minority are political/war refugees. Hmong, Vietnamese, etc.  
Merit is already an American value; they just take it to the greater extreme than many 3rd gen Americans would.

Refugees are typically geographically separate from your standard H1B Asians (Indians and Chinese/Taiwanese but also some Vietnamese, Sri Lankans, Pakistani, etc...).  Most of those Hmong you mention are kind of stuck in the middle of the country and don't have the ability to influence SF / NYC in any meaningful way.  And as we've already agreed, nationally there's not enough Asians to move the needle, even if all Asians were unified.  

Is Merit really an American value?  Given that we've had affirmative action in the country to the detriment of Asians for multiple decades now.  I'd probably argue individual liberty is an American value, capitalism is an American value, but merit was always something that's a nice to have but not really there in practice.  ""It's not what you know, but who you know"" is probably one of the earliest lessons all Americans learn outside the classroom.

>Diverse group of Asians (not Indians!) protesting.

That first article is a bit confusing for me.  According to the SF Gate, 

>Dan Pan, a Los Gatos resident and immigrant from Taiwan said if caps are removed, bigger countries will receive most of the visa approvals, leaving many qualified individuals from small countries to be left behind.  
""If this bill passed, the other races basically have no chance to get a green card in 10 years,"" Pan said. ""Maybe there is good intention, but there will be a bad result.""

I'm not an expert on the Eagle Act, but it's my understanding that the bill would result in faster processing for backlogged countries like India and China specifically for STEM talented immigrants, but NOT at the detriment of other countries.  In other words, if there are 500 Taiwanese applying and the floodgates for Chinese applicants open up, those 500 Taiwanese are still processed at the same speed as our current state.  But the protestors of the bill seem to imply that's not the case?

>That is seeing the Dem party as a party favoring black interests to Asian ones is a strong parallel to how white conservatives see it already toward whites.

That's fine, I think we're talking about two different things.  Conservatives see it as they've always seen it, whereas Asians now are seeing it and feeling a rising tide of influence against them.  It's not like Affirmative Action didn't exist previously, yet local Asians hadn't been shifting red until recently. 

>Perhaps given that I'm in the Bay Area. If you are upper middle class here, there's simply no such thing as an Asian dominant school that isn't competitive. In fact, among the economically assimilated population, almost all Asian/white school segregation can be credited to the desire for different levels of academic focus in the school environment, not per se language immersion.  
Ohlone Elementary in Palo Alto actually has pretty average levels of white and Asian representation even though it has Mandarin immersion. Why? (1st gen) Asians dislike its less rigorous academics and instead massively cluster at the academic competitive school without immersion.

Actually your example of Ohlone Elementary is exactly what I'm talking about here on the East Coast as well.  Here's an example of [a Korean immersion school without top tier competition](https://www.greatschools.org/virginia/centreville/3014-Powell-Elementary-School/?searchWhatType=autosuggest&searchLocationType=undefined&searchWhatKeywordValue=Powell%20Element).  I should clarify what I mean by ""Asian dominant"" though, so Powell Elementary is roughly 60% Asian, and I'd wager to guess it's pretty much all East Asian, and then 20% white, 8% Latino, 6% mixed race, and 5% black.  The school you gave was roughly 41% Asian, 32% white, and 18% mixed race (which I'd guess is mixed White/Asian) but I'd still consider that Asian dominant as Asians make up the majority racial group.  Nonetheless, there are still a lot of Asians who don't want Affirmative Action to be the norm for local high schools nor target colleges.  Think about it, shit rolls downhill.  If I'm a 2nd / 3rd gen Asian and I just want my kid to attend a B rated school (and I don't have money for private), then I want all ""those crazy 1st gen immigrant Tiger Moms"" to send their kids to Lowell.  If Lowell starts kicking high achieving Asians out, then now their kids are pushed down with my kids, and now my kids will be gate kept out, or develop some unhealthy mental issues due to how competitive his peers all of a sudden become.",t5_2sfn3
jbd2qnf,t1_jbcbza0,AnimeCiety,1678248515.0,,">Do you mean American as a nationality or an ethnicity? Need to be careful on the language here -- I'm referring to the ""American"" ethnicity, which you can also call the ""white"" ethnicity (remembering it is not limited to ancestrally white people -- e..g the 3rd gen Asians I noted earlier are viewed as ""whitewashed"" -- assimilated into whatever ethnicity the whites around them have).

I think nationality wise, it's obvious whether someone is American or not, it's a matter of legality and the science can be settled fairly quickly.  I think we need to be careful here about what we mean by American ethnicity.  Firstly, there isn't one ethnicity called the American ethnicity but really [a whole list of ethnicities that make up the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_American_people_by_ethnic_or_national_origin) In fact, there isn't even a white ethnicity!  So what we can do instead, is use the term ""culturally American"".  That is, the commonly shared set of values, beliefs, behaviors, language, food, etc... that belies Americans.  Because the US is a melting pot, a threshold of certain cultural components isn't always measurable - for example we can't say, if 25% of Americans eat sushi, then sushi is now part of American culture.  

Using ""whitewashed"" here as the base also isn't fully accurate.  3rd gen plus East Asians are usually found in states like Hawaii and California.  You're much more likely to also find non-Asians enjoying Asian culture such as poke, sushi, boba, watching anime, listening to Kpop, etc...  In Hawaii, for instance, there have been affirmative action programs put in place to boost representation for white Hawaiians.  Then you've also got a lot of south Asians of second generation who carry on the legacy of giving their kids Indian / Pakistani names and will typically practice Islam or Hinduism in some way, while still perfectly co-existing in majority white suburbs.  Typically something like a 50 white / 20 latino / 20 Asian / 10 black split - where rather than being ""whitewashed"", I'd more accurately label it - color mixing, or pot melting.  

&#x200B;

>Sure, but they aren't part of a pan-Asian identity group, not even sharing a common language. There's some common cultures in sub-groups (East Asian, South Asian, etc.), but realistically there's too much polarization between these groups (who have differing interests) to form a unified bloc.

Well, not really because we're talking about Asians who also are interested in and have been able to, immigrate to the US, right?  Keep in mind, without a land bridge, the type of Asian immigrants coming over are going to be those interested in a STEM job, capable of nabbing an H1B Visa or something of that sort.  Those who come illegally likely won't have a political impact anyways.  So although some Asians speak Urdu, some speak Hindi, some speak Mandarin, some Tagalog, they all came here based on merit, and thus will want their kids to be set up for success via merit.  

&#x200B;

>The first gen immigrants likewise themselves have competing priorities. **Your most tribal non-Indian Asians don't want the Eagle Act passed because it will result in less of their own co-ethnics coming** \-- they could care less if it results in more Indians becoming LPRs.

Care to clarify here?  I've never heard of any Asian ethnic groups being against reforming legal immigration, particularly for STEM related jobs.    


>Sounds like you don't talk to white conservatives. :)

I do, but probably not the type you're imagining with relation to political swings.  Most of the conservatives I know have been conservatives for quite some time, so talking about Democratic failings with regards to Affirmative Action isn't very high on their list.  

&#x200B;

>Yes, as the Cupertino paper discusses there's some social polarization between the 1st gen Asian immigrant parents and 3rd gen+ anyone else especially on intensity of education. I see it in my own city, where highly academic private schools are disproportionately more 2nd gen kids compared to the (very good) public schools. But in practice, it doesn't really seem to cause major political issues -- in Cupertino, the 3rd gens just moved their kids to private schools and were done with it -- there's not a lot you can do politically to change ""competitive school"" environments.

Again, I'd recommend reading ""Race at the Top"" specifically when it comes to things that can be done politically to change ""competitive school"" environments. 

>And besides, this is a local issue, literally an issue at the school board level. The amount of stuff where you could have any pan-1st gen Asian alignment is rather small compared to the stuff where you don't.  
But 2nd gens? Not really -- vast majority I've chatted with would never want to send their kids to a 80% 1st/2nd gen Asian school in the Bay Area because their educational values align more to the 3rd gen whites than 1st gen Asians.

Yes, I'll reiterate that Asian Americans don't have the numbers to move elections on the national or state level particularly due to those differences between them and African Americans.  But at the local level?  I think it's quite noticeable and this does have bigger ramifications for cities like SF / NYC where media coverage is more highly concentrated.

That second part I believe is where you might be mixing things up between ""competitive Asian dominated school"" vs ""Asian dominant"" school.  On the East Coast we've had a lot of immersion schools pop up where teachers will speak to students in Mandarin / Korean / Spanish, etc...  This obviously attracts a disproportional amount of Asian kids to these schools, but that by itself doesn't make the school extremely competitive.  There are a lot of average Asians, even low achieving Asians, that have parents who just would rather they go to a school with a bit more Asian culture.  Of course there's also Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech which just happen to only take the highest testing students, and they all happen to be Asian - that's what I mean by ""competitive Asian dominated school"" vs ""Asian dominant"" school.",t5_2sfn3

A white and black person in the same neighborhood in Philly will have more in common with each other than a Nigerian immigrant.  On the other hand, there's tremendous difference between a Hmong refugee and an East Asian child of professor immigrants.  The Hmong refugee would have more in common with a Venezuelan refugee but AA does not take experience into account. 

The other issue is actual productivity of your total adult population.  Yes there is value in diversity but that does not trump actual merit.  Take the NBA or NFL for instance, there are almost no Asians in them and nobody clamors for Asian representation via Affirmative Action.  Because at the end of the day, performance matters.

My biggest gripe with AA is that it over-emphasis the identity of race as an all-encompassing proxy for childhood advantages in trying to equalize the playing field at the college level.  NYTimes has talked about in the past AA leading to a third of Black Yale Alumni ended up being Nigerian immigrants rather than the descendants of slaves that you and I likely think of most directly impacted by America’s historical institutions.  

And on the flip side, it groups all Asians as one privileged monolith.  It ignores that while some East Asian or Indian immigrants are the best and brightest who raise their children in academically inclined environments, there are also refugees from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar etc… that grew up very poor with no culture of academics who are then further penalized by AA.  

As an Asian who grew up in a single parent household, I don’t have much of a chance when competing with Malia or Sasha Obama, but AA further and unnecessarily tips the scale in their favor.  

And I think the track record of AA speaks to the fact that it doesn’t help the average black American.  AA first kicked off for colleges in the 60s but really ranked up more so since the 90s.

I would be in favor of a revamped AA where colleges can transparently weigh economic background throughout childhood as a factor rather than purely using race.  

But the real issue is the 18 years that go into molding a child before he or she even applies to college.  If only 30% of black Americans are going to college then the immediate prioritized response shouldn’t be to see if we can get some of those 30% into elite schools based solely on their race.

He seems very much to be stating that diversity should not be a goal.  Representation of underrepresented groups should not necessarily be increased at demanding institutions unless under-represented group applicants are just as accomplished as people who get in through a race blind system.

Then, we can quantify how much less capable the group they are drawn from is on average.

What demographic group someone is arbitrary.  I could just define the underrepresented demographic at X school as ""not Chinese, Indian or Jewish"" and decide I need preferences for any kid not Chinese, Indian or Jewish (including white gentiles).  We don't do this -- why not?

(The studies authors also don't seem to recognize this fact. Either way, they explicitly note their research ""cannot inform policy on its own"")

>That is somewhat true, however, with enough demographic representation you can utilize anti-Racism resources at the point to mitigate the effects

I don't see any evidence of a minimal representation is needed.  More to the point, how much ""representation"" is enough?  Are you talking about a ""critical mass""?  Note that there's less Filipinos than Hispanics at Lowell (even if a higher percentage of Filipinos relative to SF demographics are present) -- so which way are you arguing for preferences?

I've been in advanced-academic classrooms where I was only one of two white students, with everyone else being Asian.  I didn't experience [statistical discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_discrimination_(economics)) though because everyone knew I was in that classroom by merit.

It's not just ""somewhat true"" - it's strictly true that preferential treatment increases statistical discrimination.  I would see it as strictly worse *for me* personally if we started preferentially admitting other white students because ""not enough of the best of the white students"" are present.  It would obviously create an environment where the average white student is believed by the majority to be less qualified and thus I myself would suffer from  which otherwise would not have existed.

Note that merely conducting ""targeted outreach"" (a light form of affirmative action) does not create these particular problems.  The University of California heavily uses it - and I (and most people) support such programs.

>Affirmative Action can actually resolve racism in our lifetimes.

There is no plausible way that forever dividing people explicitly by their immutable group identity as a way to confer benefits resolves racism.  I suspect exactly the opposite; see the arguments in [Affirmative Action in the World.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_Action_Around_the_World)

Huh? I'm not sure what you mean. Most variance of whatever you are trying to measure is within a group than between groups, regardless of what a ""group"" is.

The problem with affirmative action programs using too high levels of preferences is that you can create an academic environment where the mean difference between groups at an institution is large (and because of the selection process the variance within non preferred groups is small).  That's what causes the ""looking down"" effect.

If I decided blue eyed people were underepresented and started heavily preferring them, people at the institution would start assuming a random blue eyed person is more likely than not below average. I.e. the brown eyed people would ""look down"" on the blue eyed people.

Again, if your primary goal is to minimize racial elitism in an environment, the solution is to end merit based schools. That way, you widen the variance within ethnic groups at the institution. Alternatively, end all preferences. That might make the preferred group less represented, but the mean group difference would drop dramatically - reducing statistical discriminatation.

> why affirmative action exists to prevent race superiority

That's not my interpretation of why. It was supposed to be a temporary measure to allow a formerly heavily discriminated group to rapidly advance to where they'd be absent discriminatation. (Or more precisely, counter statistical discrimination).  If it lasts forever, it can be [actively harmful](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coate-Loury_model) to the preferred group.",t5_2qh3u

The term is used in many different ways, but generally it isn't used this narrowly. In fact, you can have differential results based on race (conditioned on everything else you search for), which we'll call ""racism"", without anyone having personal animosity.

A good example is [statistical discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_discrimination_(economics)), which has been proven to exist in a variety of scenarios (resume tests, police racial profiling, etc.). If X group is known to be performing worse or better on some metric, people might use group membership as a proxy to predict an individual - even though no animus is involved. They only ""policy"" driving it is a personal desire for efficiency.

The argument then is that the presence of this discrimination leads to members of affected groups internalizing stereotypes and trying less. (Correcting this is one of the original justifications for affirmative action in fact. )

I'm fine taking that position, but that means we can't use racism in the school to argue one way or another.  We have no idea, so I'll reject the idea that Lowell is particularly racist absent hard data. And most importantly, I see no reason racism wouldn't *increase* if you added an affirmative action policy, because the academic differences would only increase along racial groups.  Again simple data would show one way or another as Lowell has changed its enrollment criteria over time.

If you want to rely on anecdotal data, well, racism issues existed even when affirmative action existed.  Here's a 1995 [article](https://www.edweek.org/education/cursed-by-success/1995/04) with a student stating: "" Her black and Hispanic friends ... often feel that the school’s Asians view them as less intelligent and expect them to fail.""

>Fair is NOT what the data looks to be fair to YOU, fair is how the public perception of FAIR is.

And here's where we agree. It's just perception in the end. Fine get rid of Lowell and you can sweep the academic achievement gap under the rug, but you haven't fundamentally changed it.  And even if you practice affirmative action at Lowell, well, that still doesn't ""help"" the 99% of students that don't attend it.

>Lowell overwhelmingly helps Asian Americans and White students far above even the overrepresentation baseline we discussed earlier of 50%, and now you have the audacity to take 8% of the Black population's money with 4x less chance for them to even be represented at the school, which doesn't even account for the Latinos and other populations?

This is only relevant from a ""moral"" position if you believe I should value a social benefit more that I don't personally receive if it is allotted to someone with my ethnic background over someone who isn't.  (I strongly reject such a belief for what it's worth - perhaps that is where we differ.  And yes, I recognize some people do see the world this way -- but I don't think such a position should be embraced)

Alternatively, you may be modeling Lowell as a random lottery that is biased for people in some groups over others.  But that's not how it works; it is merely selecting the top academic achievers.  Being a member of X group is not in itself *causal* to that, it is that the top academic achievers are distributed along different ethnic lines than the general population.

In other words, Lowell is *not* a universal program for all people; it's a program for a select group of people (high academic achievers).

I would just as much hope that an Asian person doesn't oppose whatever X program because Asians are underrepresented.  We're a country of individuals.

Generally I think the current UC acceptance policies are generally pretty solid.  I think it's worth running experiments in how much weight you want on school quality/economics (UCB this year [heavily dialed up preferences](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/16/uc-berkeleys-push-for-more-diversity-shows-in-its-newly-admitted-class/)) as long as you truly track how students progress through the school.  There's not much point using higher preferences if you don't achieve higher lifetime outcomes for the preferred students.

Brazil's affirmative action programs have been quite [successful](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-23862676) \- the preferred students are doing just as well as non-preferred suggesting something was ""unfair"" about the previous admissions system.

Unfortunately, you don't see this effect in UCs as well - where graduation rates for [preferred groups](http://projects.dailycal.org/2020/aff-action/) have historically lagged to the point that UC themselves started dialing down racial preferences in 1995 before they were outright banned.

>. By choosing to weight economic disadvantage, children from poor communities of all ethnicities get a boost, which eliminates that problem while still providing some much needed help.

Again, I really want to stress that if you solely used parental income (or even wealth), you just get more Asian kids.  Here's a [report](https://resources.corwin.com/sites/default/files/singleton_2e_figure_3.2.pdf) from 2010 -- Asian students with parents earning under $20k are scoring as well as Black students whose parents earn over $200k.

While UCs use school quality, the difference really isn't entirely explained by it as you noted.  Here's an example of a [school](https://www.greatschools.org/california/san-jose/5456-Independence-High-School/#Low-income_students*Test_scores) in San Jose that's half low income students that's heavily Hispanic and Asian (mostly Vietnamese and Filipino) with similar incomes across  and you can see the same pattern in both test scores and college readiness.

As I note above, we need to clarify what we are trying to solve  If it's just help poor kids, let's weigh income more -- most people are fine with that.  But that doesn't help with the racial achievement gap (which you may be commenting on with your note about systemic racism); the entire controversy about NYC's specialized schools is not a lack of low-income students attending them (they are majority low-income) - it's that they are [almost entirely Asian](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/nyc-schools-numbers-black-students-diversity-specialized.html).

As far as I've seen, earlier [interventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_to_Opportunity) help here (but don't solve the problem).  At the minimum, we should encourage integration more, by at least removing disincentives (better enforcement of fair housing laws, etc.)

Affirmative action is legal in most states by virtue of there not being a ban.

Overall though, there is a sense from CA, that people are willing to have race-concious policies, just not policies that explicitly define beneficiaries by race.

There's nothing to ""propose"" as there's no prohibition on doing this.  Every college (including the University of California) uses income affirmative action where racial preferences are banned.

In fact, while income based affirmative action helps with socioeconomic diversity, it achieves very little diversity as defined by reducing under-prepresentation of underrepresented minorities (or whites for that matter).  Especially in California, you have the ""problem"" that poor Asian students outscore basically any other group (regardless of income).  Effectively, universities achieve racial diversity today not by income, but by relying on racial segregation -- applicants from worse schools get a boost.

Ironically, if our schools weren't segregated, this ""local context"" couldn't be used -- you'd wind up with universities that are even more Asian.  Here's an example [school](https://www.greatschools.org/california/san-jose/5456-Independence-High-School/) \-- you see little UC eligibility difference by income but a major one by ethnicity (white, Hispanic and Black students in one cluster and Asians in another).",t5_2thqg

The diversity justification is very different from what you describe:

Due to gender imbalances in applications, many engineering programs prefer women (and therefore discriminate against men); liberal arts programs prefer men (and therefore [discriminate against women](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/opinion/to-all-the-girls-ive-rejected.html)).",t5_2w844

* With race, we have outperforming immigrant groups (e.g. Asian immigrants) geographically concentrated where-in purely academic admissions will result in high over-representation levels.  Controversies have come up at pure test-driven high schools not because the relative representation of under-represented minorities to white students is dropping (it's holding steady), but because Asian out-representation is driving down everyone's numbers.  University of California is only keeping those numbers ""down"" through some heavily race-concious socioeconomic affirmative action (basically a variant of % plans).
* Gender is an even more interesting one.  We now are at the place where women go to college at a higher rate than men. Women are underrpresented in STEM, but overrepresented in liberal arts - leading to universities using affirmative action (at the minimum targeted outreach) to diversify various respective majors (both ways).

>So since the ignorance of race that income-based affirmative action necessitates doesn't address this profound issue, it's apparent why it's mostly faded in importance in the current political discussion.

First off, UCLA heavily uses a wide variety of socioeconomic indicators in admission including income.  Secondly, the reason it fades in importance in political discussion is there aren't strong political movements strongly fighting ""being poor"" in a race-neutral way, but there are around different ethnic groups.  You can read a massive essay by Kahlenberg (who is in that nytimes debate you linked) which notes the [political problems](https://tcf.org/content/report/achieving-better-diversity/) which results in prioritization shifting.

>The conservatives who oppose affirmative action have not...

Let's not ignore the liberals who oppose race-based affirmative action, such as UCLA's own [Richard Sander](https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/richard-h-sander) who extensively works in Fair Housing. (Or Kahlenberg for that matter)

>many BIPOC high school students have to use their time to care for siblings, work, and/or do familial tasks that their parents just don't have time to do, since they're already trying their best and taking all their time working

Just to be clear what are you defining BIPOC as? Generally POC means anyone non-White (i.e. inclusive of Asian). Are you using this solely in the ""BI"" sense? (Black & Indigineous)

Regardless, this is a socio-economic consideration. A school absolutely can consider that aspect of a student.

>there's a compelling hypothesis: race-based affirmative action will result in well-qualified Asians being replaced with under-qualified BIPOC people.

No, that's not what is actually happening. It's key to note we're not introducing preferences, we're shifting preferences from purely SES to some racial.

So what it is actually doing is reducing socioeconomic preferences that benefit poor Asians having household difficulties you earlier describe with more affluent members of other ethnic groups that have less difficulty, but with roughly equal academic credentials.

If anything, the group losing out has more difficulty finding alternative schools than the group that benefits.

>that it's more about equity rather than equality.

So, see the point above. SES is about equity. UCLA has an enormous number of low-income [students attending](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools).  It's hard to put this into a simple buzzword, but if you want to be cynical, it actually let's universities admit fewer low-income students (save money) and solve political pressures. (see last 3 paragraphs of this [article](https://edsource.org/2020/california-universities-prepare-for-possible-return-of-affirmative-action-in-admissions/634178)).

>But we have to recognize that for Asians, the amount of racism we experience is incomparable to the racism people in the BIPOC community experience

Your examples are somewhat conflating socioeconomic difficulties (which SES can factor in) and racial discrimination. 

As is well known, you can find racially discriminatory policing practices against non-Asian POC.

* In a system with heavy economic affirmative action, the only beneficiaries are *affluent* applicants that have the desired ancestry.

That is completely wrong. Affirmative action in universities actually can't be remedial at all and can only be for diversity. ([Bakke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_Univ._of_Cal._v._Bakke)).

Yup.  There was [retaliation](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article2594974.html) against Asian American lawmakers in 2014 after they blocked the original attempt to re-instate affirmative action.

Nor is this issue new.

Because the NAACP was a defendant (they had set up the decree), few of the traditional civil rights groups (e.g. ACLU) were willing to get involved.

It's intrinsic that in CA affirmative action would reduce the admission rates of poorer Asian Americans as preferences move away from socioeconomic to racial.  POC are over-represented (77% of the system); any under-representation of non-Asian POC is largely caused by Asian *over-reprepresentation relative to non-Hispanic whites, not white over-representation.* Again these are the representation levels (% of a group at university divided by % of 18 years olds in a given group) in admissions UC wide:

* Non-Hispanic White: 86%
* Black: 92%

>“Because it is much cheaper to provide racial preferences to upper middle class Latino and African American students than it is to do the hard work of recruiting economically disadvantaged and working-class Latino and African  American students, I fear that many of these progressive reforms could be diluted if 209 is repealed,” he wrote in an email to EdSource.",t5_3d1js

* Prop 15: I'm yes, but this isn't going to affect new property purchasers like Facebook - it only affects those that purchased long ago that have had their property tax increases limited relative to appreciation due to prop 13. 
* Prop 16: I'd argue no as it would immediatley allow discrimination against minorities. Affirmative action in higher education student admissions in California (where only 23% of UC students are non-Hispanic white) to alleviate racial inequity largely means making it *harder for Asian Americans* to be admitted and easier for anyone else (if you look at the numbers in UC admissions and compare to say high school graduates in CA, Asians are about 2x overrepresented, non-Hispanic whites and African Americans \~90% and Hispanics at 70%).
