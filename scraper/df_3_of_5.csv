>Chinese Exclusion Act and the subsequent Geary Act had nothing to do with black people.

I never said it did. But clearly something is driving black people to commit the highest share of hate crimes against Asians.

>Hollywood with their negative and polar depictions of Asian males and females has nothing to do with black people.

Yet even still this is not enough to build comradery and support among the minority populations.

>There are many perspectives on affirmative action, but at the end of the day, it pits minorities against minorities with Asians getting the shit-end.

Affirmative action is NOT the driving force behind VIOLENCE. Your points are going over my arguments.

But even while most black people ostensibly receive more benefits, more popular support, and more privileges, they still choose to dish out their anger on Asians. American's founding, discriminatory laws, and Hollywood films do not excuse nor explain why black hate is directed at Asians. 

>There's no purpose to your response other than to spread the blame to black people in a thread that highlighted a white-on-Asian attack.

No, it is remind you to not fall into the media trap. What ever happened to Stop Asian Hate?

It stopped itself because the most amount of crimes were unequivocally committed by black people against Asians and the media silently backpedaled. I never excused the actions of white people. Rather, you intend to paint all white people as villains (the same way the anti-Asian left does) when the lived experiences of many Asians, such as myself, have often been in inner cities where black on Asian crime is so frequent yet so ill-reported.

Tell me, name one black person who violently attacked an Asian... You mean to tell me despite the overwhelming evidence that not a SINGLE act of hatred was reported on by the media? Was not to the same magnitude of the spa shootings?  
You give the media dogs a bone only when it suits your own outrage. I'm not shielding whites or dogging on blacks.

I am addressing YOUR attitude.

>My existence caused white people to hate me.

No, the terrible moral compass of select, powerful, wealthy individuals has propagated their beliefs onto a largely ignorant group of people. Look back before the 1700s. Black and white relations were not nearly as bad. In fact, some would even call it amicable. It was only until the dramatic increase of slaves that racism truly flourished. This ultimately only benefitted the wealthy southern elites who had need of large amounts of labor even to the behest of many.

Again, this does not excuse vile behavior but it puts things into perspective. Other minorities, if we are to believe the left, have had no platform for power to this day. What explains their hatred of Asians? 

Does my existence cause black people to hate me? Or do we blame the actions of others on a different group of people? I don't blame the Japanese of today for what they did to Korea and China and I certainly will not try to heap the sins of Japanese imperialists onto ""white supremacy.""

>Why wouldn't I hold negative perspectives on people I didn't do shit to, but continually does shit to people that look like me?

Your feelings are, once again, on full display. That anger is justified for the most part. However, why are you not holding other people - other people that are statistically more likely to hurt us RIGHT NOW - to the same degree of contempt?

Lastly, the entire point of these programs, whether it was successful or not, was NOT to tell people how racist they were, despite popular belief. It is to acknowledge structural problems in the workplace that prevent minorities from getting hired or advancing, not necessarily due to any one individual's racism or prejudices. Either there are some really bad actors who are explaining this wrong, or there are people who are misunderstanding it and thinking they are being attacked as being racist.

Discrimination against women certainly still exists, but there's a very clear trend among engineering companies to hire more women. I see it in my company, i heard it at career fairs between recruiters and female candidates (sometimes being pretty explicit), I see it in recruiting/career pages where you see pictures of intern classes or new hires and the ratio of women to men is far beyond what you see in the classroom, I see it in where my friends have ended up based on their social media pics of their incoming cohorts, I see it in leadership development programs that are only open to women and underrepresented minorities, etc. 

And I don't even think it's a bad thing. Diversity of thought/perspective is extremely important. Everything being designed and approved by men is why women fare worse in car accidents, it's why products for women don't get funding for being ""too niche of a market"", it's why almost all the boomer and genx women engineers I've met have been kinda dickish cause they had to spend their whole careers ""leaning in"" instead of being able to exist beyond the dominant male institutional culture, it contributes to pay discrepancies, etc. 

But none of that contradicts that this shift is in fact real and happening and is really just the continuation of affirmative action, which historically benefited white women the most. 

It's also a lower level reflection of leadership having more women added in recent years. The men in power didn't suddenly realize the value of these women; they just realized you can't have four Johns in the C- suite and boardroom anymore. ",t5_2s8xv

*Back in August, Abbot and a colleague criticized affirmative action and other ways to give candidates for admission or employment a leg up on the basis of their ethnic or racial identity in Newsweek. In their place, Abbot advocated what he calls a Merit, Fairness, and Equality (MFE) framework in which applicants would be “treated as individuals and evaluated through a rigorous and unbiased process based on their merit and qualifications alone.” This, Abbot emphasized, would also entail “an end to legacy and athletic admission advantages, which significantly favor white applicants.”*

>But what if we live in a world where by not having affirmative action we create (or rather maintain) a permanent racialized underclass?

The problem with disparate outcomes actually don't have anything to do with race.  It's way more nuanced than that.

1) The ""asian advantage"" in education mostly comes from poor asian immigrants.  Successive generation of asian kids have poorer academic results, actually matching white students.  Which doesn't surprise me, wealthier kids tend to be lazier.  I'm kicking myself for not saving the link for this, i was trying to find it, and i can't find it anymore.  I'm old enough to remember when the Chinese international students who came to the US to study in colleges were poor as shit and they thrived.  Now it's the rich Chinese international students who can't even speak English who do poorly at the university level (but colleges love them because they pay full tuition).  

2) Black academic struggles are a result of a broken family structure.  ~70% of black children are born to unwed mothers, which is astronomically high (it's something like... 30/40% of white kids, and 10% of asian kids, don't remember the exact numbers, but much much lower, you can google it).   Children of single parent households are a) more likely to drop out of school b) more likely to use drugs c) more likely to commit suicide, d) more likely to get in a fight/join a gang/go to prison.  Fixing education for the African American community has to come from fixing the African American home FIRST.  Placing black kids who grew up in broken homes, in broken schools (and these schools are broken because most of the other kids come from broken homes, not because of 'lack of funding' or 'school quality') and placing them in hypercompetitive schools is setting them up for failure.

And addendum to point 2 is: Nigerian immigrants actually outperform Asian immigrants in education, having higher rates of educational attainment (Partially because asians don't all share the same culture of education like Indian/Chinese/Korean/Japanese kids do... like Hmong, Vietnamese, Filipino etc. underperform).  Some idiots will say stupid shit like, 'well, it's RICH nigerians who are performing well', as if a country with a purchasing power parity that's 90% less than the US produces a lot of 'rich' nigerians.  I'm supposed to believe the Nigerian taxi driver who works his ass off for his kids and pushes them to do well in school came from 'wealth'.",t5_hitz3

There's a reason why The Wire is used as a textbook for sociology classes at Yale, Harvard, Duke, etc.

And we often forget that this acts as a butterfly effect that may destroy individual families. 

What is also great is that it does not have an easy solution. Because the problem is complicated. Even though David Simon is a liberal, you can also take some conservative conclusions from the problems he poses, as we see the effects of the breakdown of the COMMUNITY in the ghettos, from the loss of the traditional family. We also see the meaninglessness of the so-called liberals in enacting actual progressive policies, as many, even the idealists either soon join the game or are ousted.

Asian Americans achieve at higher levels (based on objective factors; you have no data regarding subjective factors) and deserve more spots. However, there is a quota in place.

There is no question the anti-defamation league would call these policies ""anti-semitic"" and racist if put in place today. Yet the same thing is done towards Asian-Americans. Educate yourself.

There are valid arguments, especially for slave-descended black people, for affirmative action for minorities.


There are no valid arguments for what is in essence affirmative action for white people relative to Asian Americans.

Controlling for socioeconomic status, white/Jewish people enjoy immense privilege compared to other groups. And yet, they get a significant boost in college admissions compared to their Asian-American peers.

>Basically, his study says that if a school ""used to be"" 100 seats divided into 80 whites and 20 Asians...

Additionally

> how much it impacts highly selective state schools, such as UT-Austin

LOL, are you a UT-Austin admissions officer? Trust me, very few Asian-American applicants care about state schools in the affirmative action debate. UCs' affirmative action policies were heavily reduced and UVA, UNC, Michigan don't impact Asian-Americans that much.



>HYPS all have Asian student populations hovering at around 20%, therefore blah blah blah


This is such an awful argument. I really wonder if anyone who makes this claim has ever taken a science course in his/her life.

Assume you have 100 spots and a holistic review of apps considering essays, ECs, test scores, anything miscellaneous, can spit out a number on a 1-10 scale.

1000 applicants with 700 whites, 200 asians, 100 URMs.

700 whites = 650 with 5s or lower, 40 with 7s, 10 with 10s.

200 asians = 100 with 5s or lower, 20 with 7s, 80 with 10s.

URMs = 90 with 5s or lower, 10 with 10s.


If you take all 10s: you have 10 whites, 10 URMs, and 80 asians.

Is this not a fair course of action to take all the 10s? They wrote the most amazing essays, won national and international academic competitions like ISEF, demonstrated leadership above and beyond the school level, have perfect or near perfect test scores, and demonstrated artistic and athletic ability at the state and national levels.

No, the current system says. There are ""too many Asians.""

Is it unacceptable that one group just has better applications on average?


I think it's perfectly acceptable, it just depends on racism by adcoms. Right now, Jews make up less than 2 percent of the population, yet they are over 25% of the undergraduate population at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Penn, etc.

Where is the outrage? ""Too many Asians TOO MANY ASIANS THEY TERK ER SPERTS"" and yet not a peep about Jewish overrepresentation. Maybe it's because in 2011, 20/24 of the top 3 administrators of the Ivy Leagues were Jewish or had Jewish spouses. Or, Jews are accepted as White while Asians are the dirty, nasty, stinking, robotic Other.

350xs3,,ringostardestroyer,1430887338.0,China,"Reward to effort ratio comparisons There seems to be a very clear hierarchy of which demographics have the highest and lowest reward to effort ratio. I don't have actual numbers or statistics to demonstrate this but the way society treats certain types of people validates my theory.

For example, Affirmative Action in education and the workplace is the easiest way to describe this concept. Asian males, bar none, have the least reward to effort ratio in this regard. We simply have to put in more work to achieve the same parity of success of other race and gender combinations.

Demographics that most benefit from AA:

Black women

Black men

Hispanic women

Hispanic men

Native American women

Native American men

White women (this has been shown in studies. given the recency of 3rd wave feminism this is hardly surprising)

White men, while they don't benefit directly from AA, obviously run the country and top firms as well as being part of the majority race. This automatically gives them advantages. The problem with Affirmative Action is that it tries to equalize these advantages in a way that's systematically impossible given that it is a ""privilege"" redistribution plan that works against sociology. It hurts us the most as we fall through the holes. We're treated as white by AA without any of the true sociological advantages of being white. Jews are on the other side of this spectrum, phenotypically white and also recognized as an oppressed minority (I've referenced how OP this is)

It doesn't stop in academics and finance. We're all familiar with the idea that asian men have to work harder than other men to get the same quality mates in the anglosphere. We have to be that much better than the average to achieve the average. That's the damning thing: our reward to effort ratio seems low in almost every aspect of life. How did this even happen?

I have no resolution. All I can say that Asian men as a whole have more grit, work ethic, and resilience than any other demographic given these obstacles. We can put with bullshit and STILL succeed. Everybody else whines for the goal post to be moved. I'm just asking for the goal post to be the fucking same for everyone.

Why is it that we specifically as a demographic have to work so hard for the least return on investment? Why is it that Tyrone or Miguel can score 1-2 std deviations below average MCAT scores and slide into medical school?

Why does society punish us for working hard?  Maybe we should just start rioting because our kids have to score 200 more points on the SATs just to be considered on the same level as others.",t5_30c2m

First, if a white person (or black or Hispanic person) is really smart, they are often praised for being exceptional. If an Asian is really smart, people assume ""Well, it's only because they're Asian."" It detracts from an Asian person's accomplishments by attributing their intelligence to their race, rather than the person's hard work or whatever. This can be a bit annoying but isn't too big a deal to most people.

The second and more important reason why this stereotype is harmful is the model minority myth. Because Asians are stereotyped as being academic and successful, they are often pitted against other minorities that aren't doing so well, such as the African American and Mexican communities. You're probably aware of how affirmative action is stacked against Asians. People often argue that if Asians can do so well without help, other minorities should be able to do the same as well. 

The thing is, Asians aren't a monolithic group like the African American or Mexican communities. I'm not saying that these communities are completely monolithic, but they have shared cultural and social struggles from which they draw a sense of cultural unity. Meanwhile, Asian Americans come from a plethora of backgrounds. Pan-Asianism doesn't really exist outside of the U.S., and it only started because a Chinese guy was murdered by some disgruntled workers mad at Japan for stealing their jobs.

While you have the upper-class immigrants from China, Japan, and Korea coming over for educational and economic opportunity, you also have refugees from the various Southeast Asian countries that came to the U.S. to escape persecution (the Vietnam War, Khmer Rouge, etc.). Many Asian American communities, particularly those from Southeast Asian countries, have struggled with poverty, gang violence, and other hardships since coming to the U.S. but no one cares because Asians are the model minority, they don't need help so neither should black people or Hispanic people, right? /s

cky90da,t1_ckxxnff,Miserycorde,1412238354.0,crypto jew running rampant,"Uh oh no Jesus the vast majority of black students at Ivies are well off, proportionally more so than white or Asians. 

I'm saying that these schools wouldn't be taking these foreign black kids if it weren't for affirmative action. All schools would look pretty much like Caltech or MIT without AA, 50% white, 40% Asian, 10% all other. I'm more or less okay with that, say you give native black students even more of a boost to compensate if you want to hold black student percentage at 10% or so. 

Education to some extent is inherently inductive to generational income inequality. People who are well off can afford to send their kids to better schools, get tutoring or whatever for their kids right? Their kids go to better schools, make more money. Socioeconomic status is highly correlated with education level of your parents. Cycle repeats. So we have affirmative action to try and get some poor kids in the mix. AA is entirely supposed to correct for income inequality. Problem is that it's based entirely off race and you've got all these well off students getting in from affirmative action. That does nothing to correct for income inequality and you may as well give their slots to someone else. 

Of course Removing these foreign born students won't increase the number of poor black kids but once you've moved past race based affirmative action, or at least separated for what generation you are, you can up the boost that native blacks get. Right now you can't up the boost for being black because you'll just admit more well off foreign black kids. 

There are studies on how well you can generalize results from top schools, the conclusion is usually that you can generalize in a pyramidal level, eg. Between different tiers of schools the results are still there just less pronounced. Still though, even if you limit it to the top 100 schools that's still like 300k students at the very least?

ckxxlbp,t1_ckxoti1,Miserycorde,1412205978.0,crypto jew running rampant,"Wait what? Okay, let's say a comparable amount of the Black students at other Ivies are from Nigeria. I'll bet you a cookie that a ton of the other black students at top schools are also first/second generation students. Ghana, Ethiopia, SA, all pretty first world countries that send a bunch of immigrants to the US. That takes a TON of affirmative action spots away from poor black kids. I fail to see how at LEAST 25% of the black population at Harvard being foreign isn't a big deal. All you have to do is ask on the form ""are you a 3rd generation immigrant? Are you a 2nd generation immigrant? are you a 1st generation immigrant?"" Give more of a boost to 3rd gen immigrants. Easy. 

Sociologists study how black immigrants do on tests compared to native born blacks and there's a pretty huge difference. (Immigration and Education, Grace Kao et al, I want to say chapter 4? 5? Talks specifically about black immigrants. It's pretty quantifiable how they do relative to native blacks.) if you don't make that change, then AA is just another tool used to maintain income inequality. 

Also if it were me I would just do it based primarily on class then parental education then race because I'm pretty sure all the literature says that's the order in which factors cause the biggest impact on education. ",t5_2ss5b

He was the son of two immigrants from Nigeria, one of the places that sends the most educated immigrants by percentage to the US. I'm relatively sure his parents were pretty well off. He may have experienced systematic discrimination in the US, but his parents sure as hell didn't before coming to the US. There's a reason why a quarter of the black students at Harvard all come from once country, Nigeria. Nigerians are less than 1% of Americans. While were at it, a really high proportion of Hispanics at Harvard are the children of very highly educated immigrants from Venezuela which happens to have the most educated immigrants of ANY nation. 

You really think it's fair that people who trace their ancestries back to the slave ships and have been systematically discriminated against for 200 years get the same boost as well educated immigrants from Africa? 

Just to ballpark it, he had a low 23something SAT score, some hospital experience, participated in a few choir groups I think? Took a few APs, had a high gpa. Unless he literally put thousands of hours into one of his ecs and was a nationally renowned choir singer, I can guarantee he wouldn't have gotten in to all 8 Ivies if he was white. If he was Asian, he probably would've gotten rejected from fucking Cornell.

Understandably, that'll probably never happen due to how much effort it'd take to actually judge people as individuals.

For me, and an entire subculture of Asian immigrants with the same attitudes towards their children, they won't, and yet here you are arguing that defining a person based on the broadest possible generalization is fine, because all the Asians you know are millionaires.

d7ksjvv,t3_52em9n,cwkid,1473760712.0,,"College admissions in the US can be very different from college admissions in a lot of other places.  Standards for getting accepted tend to be very opaque and based on a lot of very different factors.  Colleges barely admit to having affirmative action, except saying that they want to have a diverse class.  This makes it a bit more difficult to have a discussion on affirmative action, since the general public does not have much idea about what's going on.  For example, a lot of people say they would be fine with affirmative action if it was based on income and not race.  But I personally am under the impression that this is already happening.  A lot of colleges make a big deal about how many of their students are first generation college students.  I would be interested in seeing any evidence this is not the case.

One issue I think that affects Desis is that their values often do not match up with the values of the colleges they are trying to get admitted to.  For example a lot of people here are talking about standardized test scores, but according to their common data sets, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and Princeton all consider test scores as much as they do extracurricular activities.  MIT considers them less than ""personal qualities.""  On the other hand, I had friends who decided not to participate in extracurricular activities because they (or their parents) wanted to study for the SATs.  And even when it comes to extracurricular activities, a lot of Desis focus more on those that show their interest in math and science.  Which is fine, but most schools want to have active social science and humanities departments also.  So it's not clear to me how much of the difficulty in getting accepted to competitive colleges is because of affirmative action, or because of these other reasons.

In any case, there are many colleges where the general consensus is that affirmative action favors Asian Americans applicants, such as Vanderbilt, Middlebury, Bowdoin, and Oberlin.  Of course these college are not very sought after amongst Asian Americans, that is part of the reason why the affirmative action in their favor exists.

So these are still pretty competitive schools, even if they aren't as well known as the ones you mentioned.

85hgky,,gotlactose,1521441118.0,B.S. Biochemistry,"Dear Premeds of the Class of 2022 Congratulations on being accepted to one of the most prestigious and selective schools in the world. I still remember the excitement of being accepted to UCLA and the world of opportunities I discovered I had access to over the four years at UCLA. Truly, it was one of the best times of my life. I write this open letter as an alumnus of UCLA with a bachelor's in biochemistry who was fortunate enough to have been accepted to a California medical school as an Asian applicant (affirmative action will tell you this makes the application process more difficult)^1 and I'm currently a practicing physician^2 in southern California.

Although the excitement of being accepted to this fine undergraduate institution is still fresh, I write this for those of you who are already considering the future steps in your career, i.e. medical school. Some of this advice applies to other health professions like pharmacy, dental, and optometry school, but I personally went through the medical school process myself and ran my own business advising clients through the medical school admissions process, so I can only speak most thoroughly about that process.

Some bullet point advice for you premeds out there:

* First of all, relax. You don't need to be 100% premed from day one. At the end of the day, you have to remind yourself that you just got into college and to take everything on step at a time. I say this because some of my colleagues went full blast premed right from the beginning and burnt out early; some of them never went into the health profession.

* Only you can make the best decisions for yourself. For many of you, this may be the first time in your life where you have to make many important decisions on your own. Yes, the decision to go to BPlate vs. Feast is a real struggle, but so is the decision to commit yourself to being premed. Your parents may have their own opinions, your friends might say otherwise too. But at the end of the day, it's you who has to live your life, so thank everyone around you for their opinions and take time to reflect on what you ultimately want out of your time at UCLA and later on.

* Take time to critically think about the reasons why you want to become a doctor. I mean critically think about it. Not just because ""I want to help people,"" ""I want to make lots of money,"" or ""my parents told me I had to do it."" All of these reasons by themselves are terrible reasons to go into medicine. You will lose at least 11 years of the prime years of your life to this career (4 years of undergraduate, 4 years of medical school, 3+ years of residency) while your peers find jobs after college, get married, have kids, and start saving for retirement while you're hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Yes, as a practicing physician now, there are days I come home after 12-16 hours at the hospital and feel immensely rewarded by the lives I played a significant role in that day, but most days it's just a ton of administrative hospital bullshit I have to deal with. To help you with this exercise, my reason for going into medicine when I applied for medical school was ""I want to help people by building a meaningful relationship with my patients to impact them with one of the most intimate and irreplaceable aspect of their lives, i.e. their health."" Now that I'm a practicing physician in internal medicine, I get the chance to see a wide variety of medical conditions and help patients both in the acute state of their illness while they're in the hospital as well as follow them outpatient in my primary care clinic and see their health improve or worsen over periods of weeks to months to years. For example, a patient thanked me in clinic the other week because he was admitted to the hospital around Christmas last year with bad chronic liver disease and poorly controlled diabetes. I rehabilitated him in the hospital to the point where he could go home safely, then saw him every month in my clinic since then. His diabetes is now well controlled and I plan to put him on track to get a liver transplant.

* Your major doesn't matter. Most medical schools require 1 year of chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, physics, English, and math; some require 1 quarter of biochemistry and/or anatomy. You can be an underwater basket weaving major and still be accepted to medical school if you took all the right classes. However, most premeds tend to be majors in the life sciences department because most of the classes they have to take for their majors overlap with medical school requirements, so it's just a matter of knocking out two birds with one stone. However, if underwater basket weaving is your true life's passion, then by all means major in whatever you want and just take the required courses in addition to your major's required classes. (Underwater basket weaving isn't a real major, by the way.)

* To that end, your GPA is your number one priority (alongside MCAT score) when it comes time to apply to medical school. Tens of thousands of people apply for medical school every year: about less than half get accepted. The only way medical schools can quickly cut down on the number of applicants to consider is by filtering applicants by GPA and MCAT score. You have to have a certain cutoff in both your GPA and MCAT score to survive the first round of cuts. Some say you can somewhat compensate a lower GPA or MCAT score with the other but that's true only to a certain extent. It's much easier to start college strong with a good GPA and maintain it all four years rather than try to boost it later in your senior year or do a graduate program to pad your application. At the same time, a single bad grade or quarter won't make or break your medical school application. Take a step back and analyze why you did poorly. Talk to your peers, TAs, tutors (there are plenty of free tutors at UCLA, you just have to figure out how to find them), or even professors to learn how to improve.

* The MCAT is further down the horizon, after second or third year of college. Don't worry about it now, just learn the material well in the aforementioned science and English classes so you don't have to struggle as much when you relearn the material when you study for the MCAT. There's no high-level math on the MCAT, so don't worry about calculus.

* Extra-curriculars: research, volunteering, shadowing, work experience, leadership. Those are the biggest things you should have done by the time you apply for medical school. Quality over quantity: medical schools like to see that you did fewer things but over longer periods of time rather than a million short-term experiences. To write about each of these extra-curriculars will take an essay in of itself. In short, for research look up SRP (if that's still a thing), for volunteering look at programs at UCLA Ronald Reagan or UCLA Santa Monica, shadowing you're shit out of luck because UCLA Health sent out an internal memo a few years ago significantly curtailing informal shadowing so you have to find shadowing through your own professional network, work experience can be anything although healthcare work looks better, and leadership is mostly derived from being club executive boards and presidents but can be leadership at work or volunteering too.

* Feel free to take gap years. I didn't take any gap years between college and medical school and I feel that I missed out on certain life experiences that I hope I've made up later in life. It also gives you more time to round out your extra-curriculars. It's almost impractical to take all the courses required for medical school and MCAT, take the MCAT, and apply to medical school all within 4 years now (after the 2015 MCAT revision with all the new tested information on the test).

* For those of you who are unsure whether or not you want to be premed, do some of the aforementioned extra-curriculars and see whether or not you like them. These extra-curriculars are the ones medical schools look for in their applicants because they all have some attributes or skills that are believed to be good for aspiring physicians, i.e. research shows you can think critically to answer a scientific problem, volunteering shows that you are altruistic, etc.

I'm sure this isn't an exhaustive list, so I'll see you in the comments and my inbox although my responses will be spotty due to clinical obligations.

Edits to clarify the superscripts above:

1. In one of my comments below, I posted objective data from the AAMC about admissions data for Asian, White, Hispanic, and Black applicants showing the discrepancy in the average MCAT and GPA and acceptance rates across racial groups. However, a particularly passionate commenter felt that it added little value to the discussion that I brought up race and instead my statement about my race implied a bitter resentment towards affirmative action. I would like to clarify that I do not have such feelings. If anything, I understand the importance of matching our new generations of physicians to the diversity of our American heterogeneity. I have a more difficult time relating to patients with whom I don't share cultural understanding and values. If through affirmative action, regardless of the faults in that system, we can identify more numbers of competent individuals who are ""under-represented minorities in medicine"" to better serve those patient populations, then I'm all for it. 

2. The aforementioned passionate commenter would like to clarify that I am a resident physician currently in training. When I originally made this post, I thought it would not have made a significant impact for this specific audience to delineate the difference between being a resident physician and a board-certified, stated licensed physician who can practice medicine unsupervised. However, I was clearly in the wrong and I sincerely apologize if you, the reader, perceived my advice differently if I had been more truthful about my credentials.",t5_2qscu
