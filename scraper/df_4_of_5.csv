There is a lot of discrimination against Uyghurs. A lot of people in other provinces view them as violent criminals with no education, and despite the affirmative action they are too dumb to make anything of themselves. Now where have we seen that before.

Even when they can't participate in the subreddit itself, they'll still employ vote brigading to effectively censor opposing viewpoints and manipulate discussion, or if a member of that subreddit says something especially controversial, they'll start following them around and sending rape and death threats through PM, or mining their post history if they've been foolish enough to post personally identifying information that could get them doxxed.

Any subreddit moderator worth their salt should be taking an influx of trolling and vote brigading seriously, especially when their members are receiving unwarranted harassment, or rape and death threats. Black women are especially easy targets on the internet, and the harassment is going to be exponentially worse when they dare discuss the politics of race and sex in an open forum.

Over ideological presentation. He doesn't question the general correctness, or utility of the 'general left'. Our academics, journalists, activists, media personalities all comprise one class. They are an unofficial branch of government and are essentially unaccountable.

edit:

Just read an interview ([https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/kang-loneliest-americans-interview/](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/kang-loneliest-americans-interview/)) where Jay says this:

*I find it interesting that this book basically argues that the only political movements that exist and that we can name as explicitly Asian American are, broadly speaking, the Men’s Rights Asians (MRAzns) and anti–affirmative action Asians—people who want to keep standardized testing. Why is that?*

**JCK: There are two reasons why they’re powerful. The first is that they’re much better at organizing. The anti–affirmative action groups in particular are very well organized. There’s not that many, but there’s enough of them, and they’re really good at using WeChat, for example, to organize. They’re really good at being loud, they’re really good at finding money, and they’re really good at tapping into the right wing to organize and fund their platforms. That’s how they can bring a suit that will probably reach the Supreme Court, right? That’s how they can get a bunch of right-wing legal minds to join their cause.**

**Now, there’s no real equivalent to that on the left. Like you said, most of the left organizing in Asian American spaces is trying to actually help poor people. It’s ideological in its foundations, but in practice it’s like, “OK, how are we going to get these laundry workers better protections?” or “How are we going to get delivery workers the right to use the bathrooms?” Those are the types of left organizing that do exist. I think all that’s very important, but it’s not the big-ticket things that the right does. I do think also that there’s this sort of quiet tolerance of those types of movements, even from people who are presumably progressive or liberal. I think that is also true for \[the movement to defend\] Peter Liang \[the New York police officer who shot and killed a black man, Akai Gurley, in 2014\]—that there was much more support for that type of political action than people were comfortable saying.**

&#x200B;

So, like our activist class, Jay believes there actually is some sort of coherency re: Asian American, but these examples aren't legitimate because they are not of the general left. In fact, this type of organizing , when it is premised on self-preservation, is *dangerous*. They're on *WeChat,* which is only considered a  'grassroots organizing strategy' depending on what they're supporting in the chatrooms. It may never occur to Jay or our activist class that a coherent, sane, self-contained identity won't come organically from 'the left' because it necessarily cannot.",t5_30c2m
h5vy6si,t1_h5utdhz,ohwormthatscool420,1626796133.0,,"This is the biggest thing for me too. Being “Asian or \[ethnicity\] as completely removed from anything you do. It’s an ‘identity’ in the most American way possible: a sense of self predicated on other people ‘affirming’ you in the way you want to be ‘affirmed’. Narcissism doesn’t me you have delusions of grandeur, it’s an absence of self.

None of it is unique to these women, it’s part of a larger ideological project of our elite class. Which means it’s fashionable, which means it’s aspirational, which means any opinion contrary to Your Inner Self Is The Realest Level Of Reality is by definition unfashionable. These people believe we reached the apex of this higher, truer level of consciousness in 1964. All conventional wisdom, historical continuity, social bonds/expectations prior to then are oppressive and basically wrong. We’re definitely right this time.

What you end up seeing is something like how Asian America talks about Naomi Osaka, who by all accounts is “redefining what it means to be Japanese”. Being Japanese means you’re black and can’t speak Japanese. Why not? She “respects her heritage” (likes Japanese food). If we’re defined by a historical trajectory, simultaneously past and present, where does Naomi Osaka’s genetic lineage end up in 60 years?

All of this is, of course, diverting from the fact that Asian people essentially come to America to be absorbed. That we *already* went through a demographic shift into being white. None of this would be a problem, would be morally neutral, if they didn’t try to graft their social class’s values of unlimited openness, imagined coalition of all humanity onto the Asian Americans writ large. If they didn’t insist that we need to be so ‘inclusive’ of their white children that any positive definition of \[ethnicity\] collapses on itself.

But they do, and by way of who they are, they are winning. We see this conflict most clearly with the whole affirmative action thing. It’s always worth asking: What type of Chinese person is likely to be on the pro-affirmative action side? What type of person is more likely to be on the anti-affirmative action side? Which one of these two people is more likely to write about, in length, the authenticity of their ‘Chineseness’?",t5_30c2m

Re: Asian America you see this upper class, literate in wokeness clashing with an unacculturated underclass.

Specialized high schools, affirmative action. Then they must be properly educated. ""Speak to our families about anti-blackness in the Asian community"".

I'd also caveat that the U.S. Supreme Court did not per se support affirmative action; rather the court in U.S. v. Fisher held that affirmative action was not unlawful under the Constitution's equal protection's clause.

Similarly, the CA Supreme Court in Regents v. Bakke held that the UC system could use race as a factor in its admissions process.  As you likely know, prop 209 in 1996 amended CA's constitution to disallow governmental entities from considering race, ethnicity, or sex when making hiring/admission decisions.  I'd also point out that last year's prop 16, which would have repealed prop 209.

I personally believe that affirmative action should be used as a ""tie-breaker"" between equal candidates under a meritocracy.

I have been outright told that I only got into college because of my race, and it really hurts.

Likewise, many Asians feel that their chances are diminished because of their race.

With that said, the diversity at Yale is incredible, and I think it makes for an amazing environment. Everyone here benefits from the diversity that is brought to campus. 

But AA is a very imperfect policy. It benefits mostly wealthy minorities, and it also can't last forever. It has been in existence for around sixty years, and there is no way to determine how successful the program is or when it should end. 

Here would be my proposal to get racial diversity without Affirmative Action.

1.) Have Ivy League colleges identify high achieving black and latino students around a young age, probably sophomore or junior year of high school. This can be done through targeting high achieving magnet schools in urban areas. 

2.) Let those students know what SAT scores they should be aiming for to be competitive

3.) Give those students free SAT test prep, and monitor their progress. Try to raise their scores to be competitive with white and asian kids. 

4.) Provide these students with free and personalized admissions counseling, keeping in contact with them and guiding them through the process.

5.) During the admissions process, the schools can be race blind. But with these measures, the ethnic balance of the schools should be relatively diverse because there will be more competitive URMs in the applicant pool.

This is a rough blueprint, and I am sure that it is imperfect. But I think that this will help to provide the racial diversity that campuses want and need, meanwhile not stigmatizing the URMs on campus.

From a pan-Asian standpoint we actually want the family-based system to continue since it increases the number of Asians in the US through siphoning some of the less strategically important excess population (e.g. old people, uneducated/low skill workers, kids, etc.) while keeping the brain drain from Asian countries to a minimum.

The real issue is that the way affirmative action works in the US causes most universities to apply a de-facto three tier admission system: one for Asians, one for whites, and one for other minorities. This leads to higher standards for Asians in comparison to whites, who still make up the majority of top university populations. 

So in effect, affirmative action, whose Supreme Court jurisprudence has made admission processes into a racial black-box, is used as a cover to preserve white enrollment and keep schools from becoming ""too Asian,"" while at the same time giving a handful of token spots to lesser qualified minorities. 

The point is that while scraping affirmative action wholesale would have the side effect of helping Asians, it's not necessarily the case that affirmative action itself is completely to blame for how Asians are treated in college admission processes. Rather, it is in how school officials around the country have distorted the original intent of the policy to shift the affirmative action burden onto Asians.  ",t5_30c2m

In this scenario, Asians wouldn't receive an admissions boost despite facing systemic inequities as well, but they also wouldn't be held to a higher standard than whites.

""Admission Preferences for Minority Students, Athletes, and Legacies at Elite Universities,"" T.J. Espenshade, C.Y. Chung, and J.L. Walling, Social Science Quarterly, December 2004, 85(5):1422-1446. 

- Allegations of discriminatory admission policies against Asian-American applicants at elite universities led to compliance reviews by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights in the late 1980s at Harvard and the University of California–Berk- eley (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1992). Rising proportions of Asian Americans in applicant pools were not fully reflected in the composition of admitted students, and there were concerns that Asian Americans were being squeezed out by preferences for African-American and Hispanic applicants,

- By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission— on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.

- Average scores for applicants in each race/ethnic group are as follows: white (1347), African American (1202), Hispanic (1230), Asian (1363), and other races (1322). ... The Asian disadvantage also strengthens when controlling for SAT score, because Asian students as a group have the highest average scores.

- The odds of being accepted if one is in the top SAT category are 200 times as great as those for candidates from the bottom SAT group. African-American applicants receive the largest race/ ethnic preference (by a factor of 5.5 over whites) followed by Hispanics. Asians experience the greatest disadvantage in admissions vis-a`-vis other comparable racial/ethnic groups, including those of other races. The odds of admission for Asians are nearly 30 percent lower than those of their white counterparts.

Many in the Asian community have contended that the ban has led to an increased rate of Asian enrollment. 

- In 2014, the state assembly tried to Ban the Ban on Affirmative Action and it's notable that State Senators Ted Lieu, Carol Liu, and Leland Yee were amongst the most vocal objectors.
- Many Asian Americans also wrote articles to the Los Angeles Times citing that they would lose out if Affirmative Action was reinstated [like this article from Yunlei Yang](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-affirmative-action-sca5-asian-americans-20141001-story.html) or this article from [Frank Shyong](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html)

The methods for social control are built into the system as part of its normal functioning. Such biases are found in every major institution, corporation, organization, etc because every individual internalizes these biases and carries them wherever they go.

This is how every group, class, race, and ethnicity is kept in its place. There doesn’t need to be a Jim Crow or internment camps for the simple reason that it all operates more effectively when hidden, such that even those involved hide it from themselves through dissociation and denial.

The resentment over AA from both Asians and non-elite whites towards black/brown people is literally a perfect example of divide and conquer. 

Social mobility is falling like a rock in the US. In terms of success, well, you can probably make a comfy living without ivies. But it's lot harder to get into the elite of society without them. And while Americans like denying it the USA does indeed have an aristocracy. 

The strength of ivies and such isn't so much their educational quality but connections since you'll be bumping heads with The Who's Who of society there.

>The areas where blacks would have significant privilege would be in education/career. When it comes to some colleges blacks are not held to the same standards as other students in terms of acceptance (lower sat/act score to get in). On top the Obama scholarship granted many students a scholarship based on low standards with a requirement of being a minority. Lastly many jobs are in favor of diverse hiring and diversity quotas (there was a case where a teacher said she was part native american to help her odds of getting the position) and if that doesn’t work out you have affirmative action.

Key word, some. Just like [some white students](http://www.insightintodiversity.com/challenging-legacy-admissions/). And why get mad about there being separate scholarships for non-white students when white students seem to win [the majority of private scholarships](http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/20110902racescholarships.pdf)?

&#x200B;

And the obvious hole in this comment is that ""diversity"" doesn't mean black. Black means black. And despite diversity quotas, black people are underrepresented across the American labor market and more likely to be unemployed than whites across education and income levels.

&#x200B;

Then there is this comment:

> The areas where you would say whites have an advantage is with prisons/police. Maybe overall they do get less sentencing time (i wouldn’t know as i have not completely looked into it), but that doesn’t mean there are not some insane cases where minorities get off easy (there was a case where a black man that participated in gang rape got let off with some probation). **But the reality of this claim is that YOU have to do something to then be punished unjustly.**

> I do agree that in the rental market the name or apperance do weigh in on people. In terms of banks in this day and age they could care less. I know this to be a fact because i was in wholesale lending for 5 years. Never once did we look at a name and make a decision. Banks could care less if you are black, white brown. All they see is will this loan when packaged sell on the secondary market. Everyone that touches that loan has monetary reasons why they want the loan approved so when peoples pay checks behind on volume they could care less about the color of the applicant. As it pertains to subprime loans (which i know quite a bit about) they were never intended to target minorities. If they were then basically banks went out of their way to create a product for black people to live the american dream. No one knew the outcome when these products first hit the market. Subprime loans were not the problem then and are still not the problem now. Subprime gave people with less than stellar credit an opportunity to do something they never had the opportunity to do. The fact that the rates were high should be expected since the risk was higher. The problem stemmed from stated asset stated income 2 year adjustable loans. With those though everyone including the borrower was to blame. Just like with law not knowing isn't an excuse. Yes people were taken advantage of but there were more people who were helped than who were hurt. More homes are still current than in default from that period.

I don't doubt your experiences but when black people have consistently gotten worse loans, regardless of [their credit](https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2011/2011-033.pdf) scores [or their incomes](http://prospect.org/article/staggering-loss-black-wealth-due-subprime-scandal-continues-unabated), saying there were more helped then hurt is a bit of a cop out to me. Many of them are paying more for mortgages than they should have, regardless of whether they can pay them or not.

> With higher education though i really disagree. With affirmative action and a smaller number of eligible black applicants a black student is far more likely to be admitted into college than his white counterpart. Not to mention they are far more likely to qualify for financial aid because of the issues we've discussed affecting their community which affects a parents ability to earn. Black students are more likely to exit college with little to no debt as compared to their white counterpart because of government assistance, grants and scholarships etc. The higher education argument is no longer valid its just a matter of the black student being eligible.

Well, it 's not appearing to be true that a black person is *far* more likely to be admitted into college than a similar white person because they largely [aren't even applying to the same types of schools](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SeparateUnequal.FR_.pdf).

Let's start at the beginning.

> First of all, if you want to promote diversity in a competitive environment, you shouldn't just give passes to underrepresented groups. This does far more harm than good. Also, I would argue against your premise that people need to work in a diverse environment. Should the NBA factor in race as well, after all I think blacks are over-represented and as a result the institution suffers. See how crazy that sounds?

Besides the absurdity of comparing the NBA to college, which helps *millions* of people enter the labor force, I have to interrogate what you mean by *passes*. Affirmative action isn't a pass, it's a foot in the door, and that door has to be opened by the person AA seeks to assist. But I want to talk about diversity. People don't *need* to do anything but there *should* be efforts made to create a way for people not represented in a certain field to enter it. Now I follow the NBA so I'll quickly say this. The NBA does factor in race, most notably in its marketing and image. From its [dress code](http://www.popmatters.com/column/hill051223/) to its [age restriction](http://www.popmatters.com/column/hill051223/) to the boom Jeremy Lin created in ratings. It is what it is. And there are effects to these choices, from one-and-done college players to (what I expect) to be an increase in the number of Asian players at the high school and college level.

> I actually agree with you on the first two. I would even say those criteria are a far better standard to measure by than race. Race is far too broad a line to draw when you are focusing on equal economic opportunities. A middle class asian should not have to perform better than the children of a rich black/white family to get into the same college.

We can both agree that affirmative action could be much more inclusive in the number of factors that goes into admissions. But race must be one of them because race continues to be a factor in how [school resources are allocated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shaun-osseiowusu/turn-off-the-lights-publi_b_3592473.html) but the [types of classes they have access to](http://www.jbhe.com/features/63_racialgap.html) and even how they are [disciplined by teachers and school administration](http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2013/race-school-discipline.aspx). 

> The rest of your argument mainly applies to why underrepresented minorities such as blacks/hispanics/native americans need to be given an advantage so we can ""break the cycle"". First of all, I think there are better ways to do this. Rather than allowing under-represented minorities to get into a college they really don't deserve, we should focus on programs that try to help areas like inner-city schools so that they can achieve the level that is required of the college they want to go to. Even giving scholarships to minority groups seems more fair, because than at least it is addressing socioeconomic status, not merit. Regardless, that's just me going off on a tangent and doesn't apply to my original question. I want to know why your reasoning for benefiting Native Americans/hispanics/blacks can be extrapolated to benefiting whites as well, when compared to asians.

I again have to bring attention to what you mean by *deserve*. From experience, college admissions isn't a meritocracy and never holds itself to be one. But here is something to think about. Let's say if admissions were a meritocracy and I start from 10, you start from 30 and the goal is to get to 100. If you get to 95 and I get to 80, who *deserves* admission?",t5_2w2s8

And that is again false and reads to me that you have again not read the link I put in my last comment. Here is the point you missed, page 2:

> With only one exception (the most affluent Asians), **minorities at every income level live in poorer neighborhoods than do whites with comparable incomes.** Disparities are greatest for the lowest income minorities, and they are much sharper for blacks and Hispanics than for Asians. **Affluent blacks and Hispanics live in poorer neighborhoods than whites with working class incomes.** There is considerable variation in these patterns across metropolitan regions. But in the 50 metros with the largest black populations, **there is none where average black exposure to neighborhood poverty is less than 20 percent higher than that of whites, and only two metros where affluent blacks live in neighborhoods that are less poor than those of the average white.** 

There it is in no uncertain terms.

>  These schools are full of low income students, so it is likely in the best interest in the school to prepare students for their future based on how many are going to college.

Police violating rights has *always* been a racial issue [particularly for black people](http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/50819_ch_1.pdf) and a secondary issue to certain white populations. I would pay attention to the reading that starts on page 15 of the pdf.

Now to affirmative action. So you made [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n11ae/i_believe_that_affirmative_action_is/cces7x2?context=3) elsewhere in this thread, so I'll tackle it quickly.

> Two children are born into families completely identical except for race. Up until college they perform exactly the same, they get the same grades, same ACT scores, etc. When applying for college the minority student will be more likely to be admitted and/or be offered a larger scholarship.

Let's make the assumption that these two students go to different schools in different neighborhoods. Now, because of the fact that [the average black neighborhood is noticeably poorer than a white one](http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report0727.pdf) with a similar income demographic, it would be understandable to assume the school in the poorer neighborhood to have less resources. It would also be understandable that given these facts, the college they apply for may show a preference towards the black candidate.

Now let's look at the situation another way. Schools with high numbers of black students commonly [lack the college preparation classes](http://diverseeducation.com/article/16822/#) that are the hallmark of competitive high schools that admit many students to competitive colleges every year. So the college could make an argument to give preference to schools from which students have rarely been admitted. That too would lean towards the black student.


Now affirmation action is far from perfect, and there are a number of reforms that can be made to effectively open higher education to students who are having trouble entering and graduating. But race should be one of a number of factors that should go into how students are ranked in the admissions process. SES is one, but SES is not and should not be a replacement for race. *Both* should be used.",t5_2w2s8

Possibly, but that isn't the way *minority threat* is discussed in the paper talked about in the paper you linked. From page 1036:

> The conflict theory of law holds that coercive crime control mechanisms regulate threats to the interest of the powerful and thereby help maintain the existing social structure (e.g., Chambliss, 2001; Turk, 1969). Developed to test conflict theory empirically, the threat hypothesis maintains that aggregate measures of minority threat (e.g., percent nonwhite) predict the employment of crime control mechanisms by the police (Liska, 1992). Authorities and white citizens alike may stereotype minorities as dangerous and prone to criminality (Chambliss, 2001; Swigert and Farrell, 1976). Authorities perceive racially dissimilar minority groups as threatening to the social order (lhrk, 1969), and a relatively large population of minorities may be seen as posing a substantial problem of social control (Liska and Yu, 1992). White citizens tend to associate racial and ethnic minorities with the threat of crime (Liska et al., 1981), and the presence of minority groups heightens whites’ fear of crime (Chiricos et al., 1997; Liska et al., 1981; Liska et al., 1982). Moreover, the police may perceive poor minority citizens as directly threatening to their well-being (Holmes, 2000; Liska and Yu, 1992). Thus, the police may mobilize various strategies of coercive control to protect their interests as well as those of the larger community (see, e.g., Jackson and Carroll, 1981; Jacobs and O’Brien, 1998; Liska et al., 1985; Liska and Yu, 1992; Sorensen et al., 1993). The salience of threats perceived directly by the police should figure SMITH AND HOLMES prominently in their street-level behavior (Holmes, 2000; Liska and Yu, 1992). Minority attitudes and actions symbolize danger, and therefore, the police pejoratively characterize and differentially respond to poor minorities. For their part, minority citizens distrust the police, whom they see as threatening representatives of an oppressive power structure (Chamlin, 1989; Feagin, 1991; Locke, 1996; NAACP, 1995). They may be antagonistic toward the police and employ extralegal violence against them (Chamlin, 1989). The antagonism of minority citizens may, in turn, increase the severity of the informal and formal sanctions levied against them by the police (Smith, 1986; Smith and Visher, 1981). Given a climate of mutual distrust and threat, the mere presence and day-to-day visibility of minority citizens may amplify the risk perceived by the police and, consequently, their willingness to employ excessive force (Holmes, 2000).

In actuality, black hiring rates are lower as a whole than they were 50 years ago. Some pockets have seen some improvement, others have gone backwards. Diversity quotas and AA are nice voluntary initiatives that may help if you have the means to get an education. Otherwise they're useless. But by no means are black people *favored*, they just aren't being outright dismissed. The fact remains that if you put a white candidate and a black candidate with comparable strengths, it's a 60/40 split for the white job seeker.

Many parts of how racism works operates in the mind. So to say only tangible things matter is to say what people think of you and how they choose to help or harm you doesn't matter. It's at worst a lie and at best wishful thinking.

> Well most of those links support my theory.

Then please read them again, because I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion: 

> Affluent blacks and Hispanics live in poorer neighborhoods than whites with working class incomes. There is considerable variation in these patterns across metropolitan regions. But in the 50 metros with the largest black populations, there is none where average black exposure to neighborhood poverty is less than 20 percent higher than that of whites, and only two metros where affluent blacks live in neighborhoods that are less poor than those of the average white. 

> Historically, the government’s policies and practices have helped to create and perpetuate the highly racially segregated residential patterns that exist today. As the United States admitted in its 2000 Periodic Report,“[f]or many years, the federal government itself was responsible for promoting racial discrimination in housing and residential segregation.” Beginning in 1934,the federal government, through the Federal Housing Administration’s (“Administration”) mortgage insurance programs,   transformed the American housing market from one that was effectively inaccessible to people outside the upper- middle and upper classes to abroad based one—but for whites only.

 I just ripped two of those paragraphs word for word from a couple of the links I gave you.

> 1944 was a bad time for blacks, women (white and black), many ""white"" minorities such as Russians, Italians and Irish. But I don't see how that is relevant, if it is indeed meant to imply a justification for racially based affirmative action. A poor white man is still in the same boat right now as a poor black person with regards to attending college. 

If you don't see how it is relevant, that those three groups - that in 2013 - **are understood and treated as white people** matters in a discussion about racial affirmative action, then I really don't know what to tell you. It's very clear that they will benefit from being seen as white. 

> Yeah they can, but the point still stands all the same. Africans were not the only group to face discrimination in the past. So I don't think anyone can use the discrimination of the past as an excuse, when Africans appear to be an anomaly among those previously discriminated against groups. 

Um, yes, you can use discrimination **as a reason** to create policies geared to black people **if they are suffering unique circumstances**, which many of those papers document quite well. And I have to question if you actually read those articles if you say that.

> Yes but this way of thinking seems to assume that no white person was ever discriminated against, or faced any form of mistreatment / malign intent. On the whole, Africans were treated much worse than Whites. As I mentioned Irish, Russians, Native Americans ect ect ect were all likewise collectively treated worse than the average white person. But that doesn't mean no Whites were ever mistreated. 

Again, that has little to do with those groups opportunities **in 2013**. The only group where it demonstrably matters is black people. That is the point.

> So shouldn't he now also be eligible for assistance to help him try and catch up?

The question is, would his status as a white person/man mitigate those effects? If not, why and if so maybe not.

Wrong. **Black men**  got the right to vote because of the 15th Amendment in 1870, and most of them subsequently lost it because of Jim Crow. Women got the right to vote in 1920, but that excluded black women for the same reason. That's 50 years, not 100. And if you really want to be technical about it, most black people in this country couldn't vote without the threat of violence until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

That isn't true either. And I encourage you to look at [these sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/z89c7/university_sponsors_campaign_to_undermine_white/c639ilu) listed under housing discrimination if you honestly believe that.

At the concern of making sure the conversation doesn't go onto a tangent, I'll answer this in a separate response. Again, I refer you to the employment discrimination section of that list I linked. 

> With what? University costs money. The best universities cost even more money. The poor white person isn't going to any universities because he cannot possibly afford it, or the loans. Which is the crux of the argument, whereby economic status should determine your ability to receive government aid, not race.  

University absolutely costs money. But a while back the U.S. government subsidized veterans coming back from war to go to school. That was called the [G.I. Bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill), and it gave a chance for millions of white men to go to school but not their black peers. And now we have another two generations of white students who may attend college because they can afford it, or are legacies while the children or grandchildren of those black vets often can't.

> Again, you must surely then agree that Women should get even greater compensation then the African, and is entitled to be at the top of the ""Affirmative Action"" programs.

It's not an either/or discussion. People can be Black **and** women.  And women have been included in the groups for which affirmative action are targeted. In fact, white women are found to be the *main* beneficiaries of affirmative action. And that isn't necessarily a problem to me given the gender nature of the American labor force.  

> If you truly believe what happened 50-100 years ago is the reason race based aid is justified, you must also concede that both women and ethnicity's such as Russians, Italians and Irish are just as if not more entitled than the African. 

That was never my argument and I'll be clear. The argument is simple. **History matters.** If something happened 50-100 years ago, **and no one did anything about it**, then it is common sense to think that it would affect people living today. Now, the question becomes **how have the opportunities afforded that group changed from that past to the present?** and **what can we as a country do to resolve those problems from the past?** To which my answer is, all the groups you mention have seen sharp increases in their access to opportunity from the past up to the present, *so much so that they aren't understood by members in their own groups to be discriminated against* **except black people.** So do we think black people are worthy of our time and effort or **are they just playing the race card** as you say?

For example, how can the government desegregate cities? They're not segregated by law, they're segregated due to the fact that white people chose to flee to the suburbs.

The government can choose to no longer subsidize white people living in the suburbs by taking money that would be spent on highways and spending it on transit in cities. It could hold real estate agencies accountable for steering white people away from non-white neighborhoods and vice versa. It could rethink of how affordable housing is placed in cities. There are many things that can be done, if there is a will to do them. Not of those infringe on others freedoms, but if they did, what is more important? People disadvantaged having more access to opportunity or people not being made to compromise their privilege?

> And why do you say black people can't move where they can afford?

Because on average, black neighborhoods are poorer that white neighborhoods regardless of income. It means that more affluent black people don't live in areas representative of their wealth.

I strongly disagree.

The point that is often missed is just how much political will and resources would have to be allocated to end the need for affirmative action.

They simply dislike the idea of being ""Muslim"" and ""Middle Eastern""; if you speak to straight Pakistanis in more liberal areas, they're happy to identify as ""Middle Eastern"". They shouldn't be used to **represent** South Asian peoples - it's racist.

> * India [and Non-Muslim Asia, like Singapore] still suffers from causal homophobia derived from colonial-christian educational morals, and it's a duty of the western countries responsible for the regression (United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and any associated countries) to reverse the homophobia installed by their ancestors.

In India, the left-wing (India National Congress) are a 'socialist' and 'secular' political party. It's considered corrupt by many as the leader of the party usually comes from the ""House of Gandhi"".

Eventhough the party loves to say that it's secular, the majority openly consider the party to have a bias towards Muslims, and often overlooks problems (crime, rape, etc...) within the Muslim community in order to win their votes. The party takes bribes from Muslims too.

This will be what Europe's socialist parties will become. There have been reports of socialist parties in Europe taking bribes/donations from Middle Eastern lobbies too.

I'm posting this to say that the left-wing can be racist too; affirmative action, a policy championed by the left, is racist.

I might post on a neutral subreddit if it gets a good response here.",t5_2r18q

Muslims are a major trending issue in Europe, and Muslims are to Europe, what Blacks are to America. A lot of European countries use the media (socialist media organizations) to give affirmative action to Muslims.

Since the Muslims in Anglophone countries tend to come from Pakistan, there are more of them in western culture. I disagree with the affirmative action, and I think more needs to be done to fight the racism.",t5_2tdzg

Regardless, mainstream culture has an effect too. Muslims get so much shit in 'real life' that it's become impossible to openly discuss problems with them anywhere, in the same manner I could discuss problems with other ethnic groups. (e.g. North Indians, Hispanics, Eastern Europeans, etc...)

I explained everything in the initial post.

It matters. If I want to complain about Blacks because the majority of them are thugs, then I have to explain it. Pakistani people don't tend to be nice people. That's the stereotype. The word is used in daily life without censorship.

I'm trying to find ways to have a discussion with my guy (hi! if you come across this thread!) who is definitely receptive to a conversation. Ideally with questions for thought, rather than ""lecture-y"" tones. 

He agrees that there is an unjust system that needs fixing, and agrees with the need for affirmative action, but feels that it needs to be done without penalizing people like him. While we now have comfortable white collar careers, he barely escaped a working class life with large student loans, and it fairly informs his outlook. Many of the white male 'privileges' apply better to middle and upper middle class men than it does for working class, and he feels this viscerally. 

I did a [couple](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensLib/search?q=privilege&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) of [searches](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensLib/search?q=conversation&restrict_sr=on) in your sub, but didn't see what I was looking for.

l20ftbs,t3_1cfw1ru,Extension_River_9901,1714517799.0,New user,"  Democrats that want to expand education .Funding public universities attract foreign students.  Many of these students come from Asia and create larger demand for Asian culture in economy. 

Democrats  want to increase immigration and Republicans want to cut immigration and deport people. They want to deport even the Asian illegals in America. 

The benefits from tax cuts for higher income Asians will not be proportional to the benefits gained for white rich people.   The savings from republican tax cuts will be used to  consolidate economic power for white individuals to do and exploit what they want with lawyers and local political power, not Asians or small Asian business.  I’d like a weaker enemy not a stronger one. 


 The republicans will use Asians as a pawn to suppress other minorities, which will eventually hurt Asians. Eg. ending affirmative action, no Asians benefitted or got into schools at higher rates.  

But if I was super cynical I’d  vote Republican for the following reasons: 

Republicans make America look like a joke and that’s a good thing.   2020, Marjory Taylor Green, Trump, Neo-Nazis, reveal America is a shithole. But It’s always been a shit-hole for Asian American.  A Hilary Clinton would  maintained the western propaganda state as America=paradise, but these loud regressive white  “inject soap in my veins” conservatives are the national embarrassment the world needed. 

Corporate tax cuts speed up globalization. Republicans want to cut corporate taxes so it can pay American workers more as the market knows best. We all know its bullshit . %100 will be invested in corporate growth which probably includes a strategy of outsourcing and globalization . Countries will probably be Asian . Not a cent will “trickle down” to the dumb white republicans. 


Sun Tzu “Art of war” keep friends close, but enemies closer.  Be the batshit crazy hypocritical conservative causing infighting in the Republican Party. We need a weak Republican Party not a strong one. You can grift and say the most regressive thing as the minority pawn of the conservatives. It will increase the response from the other side.

If a black person supports reparations and affirmative action, I see it as self-interest rather than principled because they are beneficiaries.

I can, however, trust a rich person who gives everything he earns to the poor, because he has every reason not to do it and is doing it anyway.

Basically, the only time I take someone at face value is if they're directly acting against their own interests in some manner.

**Edit:** It seems the conclusion is that every act of man is self-interested, but that self-interest several levels removed from yourself qualify as altruism. Also, conspicuous sacrifice shouldn't be used as a rubric, for the times you really want to tell them apart are the very times that sophists are incentivized to fake it.",t5_2w2s8
