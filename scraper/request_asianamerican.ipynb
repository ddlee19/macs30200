Notice a lot of people in bigger reddit boards talking shit about the \"Chinese billionaire\" boogeyman (fearmongering like this also erases the less visible Asian races who came to America as refugees and reduces all Asians to a monolithic \"rich Asian stereotype\") and how this will only help them. The Chinese people I know were not coming to America with bags of cash.\n",

      "Just had a few comments/questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Has anyone come across seemingly legitimate data sets on asians & college admission with respect to Affirmative Action (AA for short going forward)\n",
      "2. As an Asian (not born in the US but pretty much assimilated here for 35+ years), I am conflicted. Research results like this one show: [https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/) that something like 53% Asians think AA is a good thing, and yet when you scroll down and look at the question of \"Should colleges consider race/ethnicity in college admissions,\" the percentage of Asians that say yes are at 21%, no at 76%.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am part of the 76%.... and I'm conflicted. I know especially for the underserved, AA makes a significant impact in giving folks better chances at life which in turn translates to diversity in every facet of work, society, life in general, which I view is a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general. In my own experience (anecdotal, totally not data science driven), I feel like AA in college admissions has hurt friends and family, in a reverse sort of sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your thoughts?\n",
      "As with anything related to Asians in politics, I'm seeing a lot of non-asian people telling us what we should do and how we should feel. I feel like this is the fundamental problem with popular politics, even when issues affect us directly, it is never centered on our experience, our perspective, and our own self-interests.\n",
      "Yet colleges will allow alumni and doners in easily without considering merit, which make up about 40% of an ivy league school. The system will remain skewed for the rich and powerful while the rest are distracted fighting for scraps.\n",
      "I just hated Affirmative Action as a distraction and a bandaid from multiple failed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are we trying to fix a problem at the *end* of the line? The problem is that Black/Latino students aren't graduating high school with the skills to be competitive for college. And note I said skills, not grades, because GPA is subjective bullshit and I've known 3.0 GPA kids from competitive schools who could run circles around 4.0 kids at shitty schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "If colleges aren't getting competitive applicants, why should they have to change their methodology to make up for the broken K-12 system? Why are we pointing a finger at colleges when we should be pointing at K-12?\n",
      "\n",
      "And so now what? Affirmative Action is not legal, but colleges will continue to artificially create a diverse environment by twisting their acceptance process until they get the result people want. And so do we continue to ignore the giant elephant in the room of what the fuck is wrong with K-12?\n",
      "My own feeling is that I was never in love with affirmative action, because it's not possible to give a preference for one group without implicitly making it harder for another group, but I supported it because I support diversity in higher education. When I applied to college I avoided applying to schools that were 90% white. I also believe that I benefited from it, because I was a first-generation college student. Affirmative action isn't just about helping black students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that in the grand scheme of things, affirmative action is only used in very selective colleges (where there are probably more valedictorians with perefct test scores than there are spots), and not where most people go to school which is community college and big state universities, which are not very selective and mainly pick based on grades, test scores, etc. Honestly, most community colleges/universities will select you if you can pay and I wish people would stop obsessing over Harvard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that admissions officers do have racial biases and that these won't go away no matter what happens with affirmative action. Anti-Asian racism won't go down as a result of the ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that overall the general support for diversity initiatives in the workplace is a good thing (overall) and that's something this ruling won't affect.\n",
      "Anti Asian racism whether against East Asians or South Asians will not go away because of this ruling, we have to keep a very close watch over many upset educators/admission officers who will do everything under the Sun to hold back deserving children going forward.\n",
      "Can we overturn legacy and athlete admissions now? What's the point of overturning affirmative action but keeping legacy and athlete admissions, except stacking the game towards the privileged?\n",
      "I want to remind people that in California, one of the most progressive states in our country, a [proposition to reinstate affirmative action lost by 15 percentage points.](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_16,_Repeal_Proposition_209_Affirmative_Action_Amendment_(2020)) Race based affirmative action is broadly unpopular overall. You'll really only find far-left progressives try to paint this as as polarized issue. Just because the head of SFFA is a conservative litigant activist does not mean you're part of the GOP because you hold the same stance of being against affirmative action\n",
      "\n",
      "I know people will say \"but why don't anti-affirmative action types care about legacies??\" The truth is most of us want to see legacy preferences done away with, but there is no grounds within the Constitution to sue a private university for engaging in legacy preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, in the oral arguments for this case, [**Harvard defended their practice of legacy/donor preference when SFFA brought up that eliminating it would increase diversity**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/11/1/legacy-admissions-scotus/)**.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that race-based affirmative action is struck down, it's no longer tenable for higher institutions like Harvard to act like they meaningfully care about diversity while having an  inherently inequitable preference for legacy/donor applicants.\n",
      "I think this is great news for our nation. While we’re at it, we should also abolish legacy admission and admission of children of wealthy donors. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a firm believer on meritocracy and equality for all. \n",
      "\n",

University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the state’s public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants’ race.\n",

      "There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). \n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, removing AA seems like a \"duh\" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.\n",

      "Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that \"Harvard graduates must be the best.\" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely.

      "Let's take a look at medical school admission. The number of slots is largely limited to the # of residency slots (funded by medicare). So it's a zero-sum game. For every white med school student is one fewer latinx med school student. For every azn med school student is one fewer black med school student. [We know that black med school students aren't as \"competitive\" as their azn counterparts](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race#part-2-medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race). (i'm too lazy to calculate confidence intervals after 5pm). \n",

So in using a utilitarian argument for maximizing public health, we *should* maximize the # of black medical students. Yes, they should be academically capable of finishing med school and passing the boards (as a dropout is a wasted slot). So sorry Sarah Chen with a 4.0 GPA from Stanford, maybe we shouldn't let you in so we can let a black student in.\n",
