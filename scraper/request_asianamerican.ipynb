      "I am part of the 76%.... and I'm conflicted. I know especially for the underserved, AA makes a significant impact in giving folks better chances at life which in turn translates to diversity in every facet of work, society, life in general, which I view is a good thing.\n",

      "But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general.

      "As with anything related to Asians in politics, I'm seeing a lot of non-asian people telling us what we should do and how we should feel. I feel like this is the fundamental problem with popular politics, even when issues affect us directly, it is never centered on our experience, our perspective, and our own self-interests.\n",
      "Yet colleges will allow alumni and doners in easily without considering merit, which make up about 40% of an ivy league school. The system will remain skewed for the rich and powerful while the rest are distracted fighting for scraps.\n",
      "I just hated Affirmative Action as a distraction and a bandaid from multiple failed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are we trying to fix a problem at the *end* of the line? The problem is that Black/Latino students aren't graduating high school with the skills to be competitive for college. And note I said skills, not grades, because GPA is subjective bullshit and I've known 3.0 GPA kids from competitive schools who could run circles around 4.0 kids at shitty schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "If colleges aren't getting competitive applicants, why should they have to change their methodology to make up for the broken K-12 system? Why are we pointing a finger at colleges when we should be pointing at K-12?\n",
      "\n",
      "And so now what? Affirmative Action is not legal, but colleges will continue to artificially create a diverse environment by twisting their acceptance process until they get the result people want. And so do we continue to ignore the giant elephant in the room of what the fuck is wrong with K-12?\n",
      "My own feeling is that I was never in love with affirmative action, because it's not possible to give a preference for one group without implicitly making it harder for another group, but I supported it because I support diversity in higher education. When I applied to college I avoided applying to schools that were 90% white. I also believe that I benefited from it, because I was a first-generation college student. Affirmative action isn't just about helping black students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that in the grand scheme of things, affirmative action is only used in very selective colleges (where there are probably more valedictorians with perefct test scores than there are spots), and not where most people go to school which is community college and big state universities, which are not very selective and mainly pick based on grades, test scores, etc. Honestly, most community colleges/universities will select you if you can pay and I wish people would stop obsessing over Harvard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that admissions officers do have racial biases and that these won't go away no matter what happens with affirmative action. Anti-Asian racism won't go down as a result of the ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that overall the general support for diversity initiatives in the workplace is a good thing (overall) and that's something this ruling won't affect.\n",
      "Anti Asian racism whether against East Asians or South Asians will not go away because of this ruling, we have to keep a very close watch over many upset educators/admission officers who will do everything under the Sun to hold back deserving children going forward.\n",

You'll really only find far-left progressives try to paint this as as polarized issue. Just because the head of SFFA is a conservative litigant activist does not mean you're part of the GOP because you hold the same stance of being against affirmative action\n",
      "\n",
      "I know people will say \"but why don't anti-affirmative action types care about legacies??\" The truth is most of us want to see legacy preferences done away with, but there is no grounds within the Constitution to sue a private university for engaging in legacy preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, in the oral arguments for this case, [**Harvard defended their practice of legacy/donor preference when SFFA brought up that eliminating it would increase diversity**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/11/1/legacy-admissions-scotus/)**.**\n",
      "\n",

      "By the end of HS or college, the attempt at a boost comes too late, often with underperforming students flunking and dropping out of schools they were unqualified for, while creating racial tensions for obvious reasons. Suppressing and oppressing one group to lift another isn’t the answer.\n",
      "My main concern is that, since the Court did not strike down *Grutter* outright, universities are simply going to find a dozen other, more indirect, insidious ways to continue discriminating against Asian applicants. They won't come right out and say it, but they'll do things like award 'admission points' to applicants of other races who write application essays about how they faced anti-black, anti-Hispanic, anti-native-American discrimination, but award no points or in fact even deduct points for students who write about how they faced anti-Asian discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in its ruling, the Supreme Court clarified in its majority opinion that universities can still consider race in admissions when an applicant highlights his or her racial difficulties in their personal background life story. It's not hard to see how universities can and will manipulate this.\n",
      "There is obviously a lot to it and no real easy answer that will satisfy everyone but for me, I want students to be admitted based on individual merit. If there are 500 spots, the top 500 students should get in. If I'm student #501 and I didn't get in, I'd want to know it's because they had better grades/scores. I'd be OK with that. \n",
      "\n",

      "TBH, I don't know the depth of how affirmative actions or college admissions work. However, I don't think this would necessarily stop negative biases against Asians, if there are any. If the biases continue to exist, this would benefit White students more as they are deemed to have more leadership qualities, and middle-to-upper class White families tend to have connections that allow the young ones develop and showcase more of these leadership qualities or take them to a higher level.\n",

If there was a quota system that simply mandated x% of any class had to be an URM paired with a system that minimized the subjective influence of the admission officer and the rest of the chips fall where may, that would be far more tolerable. Instead, we have this bullshit about personality scores that give admission officers the freedom to discriminate and favor any group as they please. \n",

      "This ruling doesn't seem to have affected any of that so the actual material impact seems like it'll be quite limited. I haven't looked at the ruling in enough detail, but I am extremely curious if these rulings mentioned anything about the usage of \"personality scores\". The really critical moment in this entire case was Alito asking the Harvard lawyer Waxman why Asian Americans get worse personality scores than everyone else. Waxman basically gave a self contradictory answer of \"we do it to triage applicants (that is, quickly reject them) but it doesn't matter\".

      "In 2013, the Court, in Fisher v. University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the state’s public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants’ race.\n",
      "I largely agree with this:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html)\n",

      "Many people have been marginalized, including Asian Americans, over time.  So the supreme court is requiring them to find a system that finds diverse candidates without disadvantaging Asian Americans.\n",
      "There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). \n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, removing AA seems like a \"duh\" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.\n",

      "Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that \"Harvard graduates must be the best.\" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely.

You can easily tell someone’s race by their name. You can’t legislate morality, you can only de-incentivize it. But I don’t think this does much to accomplish anything.\n",
      "While it’s true that legacy admissions are a grave injustice to merit-based admissions at private colleges and universities, and the fact is that they are a major issue at one of the schools (Harvard) named in the lawsuit, the fact is that UNC was also practicing anti-Asian academic racism (and let’s be honest, that’s literally what race-based affirmative action in schools amounts to, and if something has a racist effect like that then it’s no less racist than K-12 inequities are to Blacks and Hispanics) without any legacy admissions involved. Thus, while UNC has been getting less publicity than Harvard, the fact is that legacy admissions are being used as a red herring to obscure the fact that racial justice was achieved for the most forgotten Americans (Asian-Americans). This is especially true because the court was not asked to consider legacy admissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the court was indeed asked to consider legacy admissions as well, then I would agree with all the people decrying the ruling. Unfortunately, I cannot side with any of them because however small, we have to realize this is a victory for racial justice. We cannot punish those who still manage to succeed in the face of institutionalized white privilege in the name of advancing those who suffer long-term effects of slavery and Jim Crow (Blacks) and/or those who were absorbed by military conquest and faced less well-known Jim Crow-type situations (Hispanics). Moreover, the court did rule that colleges and universities are still allowed to consider a student’s observations on how race affected their life, without using race itself as a deciding factor for admissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the strongest arguments that have been made in favor of affirmative action are ultimately those rooted in economics more than race. A person whose family paid for SAT tutoring has an unfair advantage over a poor kid who flips burgers after school to feed a broken family, and this is a bigger obstacle than color or facial structure even when being dark leads to unfair police profiling. Let affirmative action be based wholly or primarily on family socioeconomic status, otherwise the biggest beneficiaries will be wealthy Black and Latino kids more than those affirmative action purports to help-and let legacy admissions be challenged in a separate lawsuit for effectively functioning as affirmative action for the generationally-wealthy.\n",

If they choose to, they can still lower admission of Asian easily by tossing out ppl with Pak/Chan/Khan last name applications.   Applicatiants can still disclose their race in their essay.

      "Let's take a look at medical school admission. The number of slots is largely limited to the # of residency slots (funded by medicare). So it's a zero-sum game. For every white med school student is one fewer latinx med school student. For every azn med school student is one fewer black med school student. [We know that black med school students aren't as \"competitive\" as their azn counterparts](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race#part-2-medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race). (i'm too lazy to calculate confidence intervals after 5pm). \n",

So in using a utilitarian argument for maximizing public health, we *should* maximize the # of black medical students. Yes, they should be academically capable of finishing med school and passing the boards (as a dropout is a wasted slot). So sorry Sarah Chen with a 4.0 GPA from Stanford, maybe we shouldn't let you in so we can let a black student in.\n",
