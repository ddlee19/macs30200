Notice a lot of people in bigger reddit boards talking shit about the \"Chinese billionaire\" boogeyman (fearmongering like this also erases the less visible Asian races who came to America as refugees and reduces all Asians to a monolithic \"rich Asian stereotype\") and how this will only help them. The Chinese people I know were not coming to America with bags of cash.\n",

      "Just had a few comments/questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Has anyone come across seemingly legitimate data sets on asians & college admission with respect to Affirmative Action (AA for short going forward)\n",
      "2. As an Asian (not born in the US but pretty much assimilated here for 35+ years), I am conflicted. Research results like this one show: [https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/) that something like 53% Asians think AA is a good thing, and yet when you scroll down and look at the question of \"Should colleges consider race/ethnicity in college admissions,\" the percentage of Asians that say yes are at 21%, no at 76%.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am part of the 76%.... and I'm conflicted. I know especially for the underserved, AA makes a significant impact in giving folks better chances at life which in turn translates to diversity in every facet of work, society, life in general, which I view is a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general. In my own experience (anecdotal, totally not data science driven), I feel like AA in college admissions has hurt friends and family, in a reverse sort of sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your thoughts?\n",
      "As with anything related to Asians in politics, I'm seeing a lot of non-asian people telling us what we should do and how we should feel. I feel like this is the fundamental problem with popular politics, even when issues affect us directly, it is never centered on our experience, our perspective, and our own self-interests.\n",
      "Yet colleges will allow alumni and doners in easily without considering merit, which make up about 40% of an ivy league school. The system will remain skewed for the rich and powerful while the rest are distracted fighting for scraps.\n",
      "I just hated Affirmative Action as a distraction and a bandaid from multiple failed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are we trying to fix a problem at the *end* of the line? The problem is that Black/Latino students aren't graduating high school with the skills to be competitive for college. And note I said skills, not grades, because GPA is subjective bullshit and I've known 3.0 GPA kids from competitive schools who could run circles around 4.0 kids at shitty schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "If colleges aren't getting competitive applicants, why should they have to change their methodology to make up for the broken K-12 system? Why are we pointing a finger at colleges when we should be pointing at K-12?\n",
      "\n",
      "And so now what? Affirmative Action is not legal, but colleges will continue to artificially create a diverse environment by twisting their acceptance process until they get the result people want. And so do we continue to ignore the giant elephant in the room of what the fuck is wrong with K-12?\n",
      "My own feeling is that I was never in love with affirmative action, because it's not possible to give a preference for one group without implicitly making it harder for another group, but I supported it because I support diversity in higher education. When I applied to college I avoided applying to schools that were 90% white. I also believe that I benefited from it, because I was a first-generation college student. Affirmative action isn't just about helping black students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that in the grand scheme of things, affirmative action is only used in very selective colleges (where there are probably more valedictorians with perefct test scores than there are spots), and not where most people go to school which is community college and big state universities, which are not very selective and mainly pick based on grades, test scores, etc. Honestly, most community colleges/universities will select you if you can pay and I wish people would stop obsessing over Harvard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that admissions officers do have racial biases and that these won't go away no matter what happens with affirmative action. Anti-Asian racism won't go down as a result of the ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think that overall the general support for diversity initiatives in the workplace is a good thing (overall) and that's something this ruling won't affect.\n",
      "Anti Asian racism whether against East Asians or South Asians will not go away because of this ruling, we have to keep a very close watch over many upset educators/admission officers who will do everything under the Sun to hold back deserving children going forward.\n",
      "Can we overturn legacy and athlete admissions now? What's the point of overturning affirmative action but keeping legacy and athlete admissions, except stacking the game towards the privileged?\n",
      "I want to remind people that in California, one of the most progressive states in our country, a [proposition to reinstate affirmative action lost by 15 percentage points.](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_16,_Repeal_Proposition_209_Affirmative_Action_Amendment_(2020)) Race based affirmative action is broadly unpopular overall. You'll really only find far-left progressives try to paint this as as polarized issue. Just because the head of SFFA is a conservative litigant activist does not mean you're part of the GOP because you hold the same stance of being against affirmative action\n",
      "\n",
      "I know people will say \"but why don't anti-affirmative action types care about legacies??\" The truth is most of us want to see legacy preferences done away with, but there is no grounds within the Constitution to sue a private university for engaging in legacy preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, in the oral arguments for this case, [**Harvard defended their practice of legacy/donor preference when SFFA brought up that eliminating it would increase diversity**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/11/1/legacy-admissions-scotus/)**.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that race-based affirmative action is struck down, it's no longer tenable for higher institutions like Harvard to act like they meaningfully care about diversity while having an  inherently inequitable preference for legacy/donor applicants.\n",
      "I think this is great news for our nation. While we’re at it, we should also abolish legacy admission and admission of children of wealthy donors. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a firm believer on meritocracy and equality for all. \n",
      "\n",
      "The push we as a nation should be focusing on is for quality and accessible early childhood education for all, regardless of socioeconomic level, which has decades of data showing it pays dividends on a student’s academic life and beyond. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of HS or college, the attempt at a boost comes too late, often with underperforming students flunking and dropping out of schools they were unqualified for, while creating racial tensions for obvious reasons. Suppressing and oppressing one group to lift another isn’t the answer.\n",
      "My main concern is that, since the Court did not strike down *Grutter* outright, universities are simply going to find a dozen other, more indirect, insidious ways to continue discriminating against Asian applicants. They won't come right out and say it, but they'll do things like award 'admission points' to applicants of other races who write application essays about how they faced anti-black, anti-Hispanic, anti-native-American discrimination, but award no points or in fact even deduct points for students who write about how they faced anti-Asian discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in its ruling, the Supreme Court clarified in its majority opinion that universities can still consider race in admissions when an applicant highlights his or her racial difficulties in their personal background life story.

      "In 2013, the Court, in Fisher v. University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the state’s public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants’ race.\n",

      "There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). \n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, removing AA seems like a \"duh\" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.\n",

      "Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that \"Harvard graduates must be the best.\" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely.

      "But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general.

      "\n",

Affirmative Action is not legal, but colleges will continue to artificially create a diverse environment by twisting their acceptance process until they get the result people want. And so do we continue to ignore the giant elephant in the room of what the fuck is wrong with K-12?\n",
      "My own feeling is that I was never in love with affirmative action, because it's not possible to give a preference for one group without implicitly making it harder for another group, but I supported it because I support diversity in higher education. When I applied to college I avoided applying to schools that were 90% white. I also believe that I benefited from it, because I was a first-generation college student. Affirmative action isn't just about helping black students.\n",

They won't come right out and say it, but they'll do things like award 'admission points' to applicants of other races who write application essays about how they faced anti-black, anti-Hispanic, anti-native-American discrimination, but award no points or in fact even deduct points for students who write about how they faced anti-Asian discrimination.\n",

      "TBH, I don't know the depth of how affirmative actions or college admissions work. However, I don't think this would necessarily stop negative biases against Asians, if there are any. If the biases continue to exist, this would benefit White students more as they are deemed to have more leadership qualities, and middle-to-upper class White families tend to have connections that allow the young ones develop and showcase more of these leadership qualities or take them to a higher level.\n",

Instead, we have this bullshit about personality scores that give admission officers the freedom to discriminate and favor any group as they please. \n",

I haven't looked at the ruling in enough detail, but I am extremely curious if these rulings mentioned anything about the usage of \"personality scores\". The really critical moment in this entire case was Alito asking the Harvard lawyer Waxman why Asian Americans get worse personality scores than everyone else. Waxman basically gave a self contradictory answer of \"we do it to triage applicants (that is, quickly reject them) but it doesn't matter\".

      "In 2013, the Court, in Fisher v. University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the state’s public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants’ race.\n",
      "I largely agree with this:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html)\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people have been marginalized, including Asian Americans, over time.  So the supreme court is requiring them to find a system that finds diverse candidates without disadvantaging Asian Americans.\n",
      "There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). \n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, removing AA seems like a \"duh\" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that \"Harvard graduates must be the best.\" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely. Will colleges still find some way to increase diversity? Of course, as they should. But soon it won't be by something as seemingly facile as race. \n",

      "Have they also gotten rid of donation based legacy admissions too? Because otherwise this is just a smokescreen. Meritocracy has always been a joke and heavily discussed in the book the myth of meritocracy as a satire of aristocracy.

      "2. Diversity is important in education, and race is part of that.\n",

      "For 1, if the argument is that race intersects with socioeconomic class, then we should be implementing affirmative action *based on* socioeconomic class. After all, there are many poor families of Asian/Indian descent, for example. And not all black/latino families are poor. Implementing a socioeconomic based affirmative action system would be far more beneficial to poorer communities compared to reducing applicants to a race checkbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2, I do agree that diversity is important in education. But I've always doubted that colleges truly cared about diversity. In reality universities consistently admit from the same wealthy families, the same elite circles, race notwithstanding. So while race-based admissions can *appear* to bring diversity on the surface, it does little to bring a genuine diversity of perspectives, experiences, and viewpoints. Which is all the more reason to move to a economic class based system. (Jay Caspian Kang says it well in his [2022 opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/affirmative-action-harvard.html): \"What do 'diversity' and 'equity' really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1% as from the bottom 20?\")\n",

      "And of course, all of this become even more questionable when you consider that many of these schools have admissions policies towards Asians that are suspicious at best. The completely opaque \"personality scores\", the higher test scores required, etc. I think we're lying to ourselves if we say that there's been no bias at all against Asian applicants, even if not with outright malicious intent.\n",

      "I absolutely agree with you, affirmative action is a step towards the right path, but it is not a perfect solution, and universities need to take further steps to address inequality in their campus. They merely provide a way to get students' foot in the door, but once in, students will still face issues. This has been a major reason in why students of color tend to drop out or transfer at a higher rate compared to white students. Furthermore, with universities placing a greater emphasis on racial affirmative action, and less emphasis on socio-economic background, many students of color that are accepted in highly selective universities tend to come from similar upper-class backgrounds.

      "i'm saying that this won't solve the symptom that we are trying to solve: asian students not getting into privileged schools. if we really want to get into it, legacy admissions is the greatest affirmative action, but no one talks about that because rick white students needs to get admitted.\n",

You agree that films depicting Asians should not be made just for the sake or representation? If you do, that's fine but just accept your hypocrisy, e.g. when I benefit it's good, when I don't it's bad, no matter my values.\n",

      "“Better” as in what ever metric they want to use that doesn’t involve qualities that you can not change or qualities that don’t matter, like race or sex.

If they want to base it off, sports, that’s ok. But it should be a metric that doesn’t discriminate on race nor sex\n",

If a black or brown student was qualified to apply to Harvard , then I assume he/she could easily get into a Cal State or UC (for example) if rejected by Harvard.

Look at the graduation for all of these elite schools- Asian Americans always come out on top. What good does it do to admit a bunch of black and brown students who then have to drop out because they cannot handle the curriculum?\n",
      "Are we sure that that is the only factor? Cost? Mental health issues exacerbated by joining a school where everyone \"knows\" you're a diversity hire? Either way, it's not like every Black or Latine student that enrolls drops out. It's a *chance.* One that we/they deserve. Because being Black/Latine means people think you're less intelligent by default and getting a leg up is so hard even when you *do* have the qualifications. And there are students who graduate and go on to do incredible things when they would have never had the opportunity otherwise. Everyone is acting as if Black/Latine students are a burden. And you're justifying it in the worst way. We could have fixed it. This is a terrible day, and once again, Black people are told to be okay with less. I don't care what you say. This is a shitty day.\n"
