The first generation of my family that came to America was *painfully* poor and everyone showed up with neither money nor education. They worked in kitchens and laundromats. Notice a lot of people in bigger reddit boards talking shit about the ""Chinese billionaire"" boogeyman (fearmongering like this also erases the less visible Asian races who came to America as refugees and reduces all Asians to a monolithic ""rich Asian stereotype"") and how this will only help them. The Chinese people I know were not coming to America with bags of cash."
TomatoCanned,,"u/Tungsten_, Thanks for creating a section just to discuss this. When I read the news I immediately went searching for a forum where folks might have civil discourse on this topic.

Just had a few comments/questions:

1. Has anyone come across seemingly legitimate data sets on asians & college admission with respect to Affirmative Action (AA for short going forward)
2. As an Asian (not born in the US but pretty much assimilated here for 35+ years), I am conflicted. Research results like this one show: [https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/) that something like 53% Asians think AA is a good thing, and yet when you scroll down and look at the question of ""Should colleges consider race/ethnicity in college admissions,"" the percentage of Asians that say yes are at 21%, no at 76%.

I am part of the 76%.... and I'm conflicted. I know especially for the underserved, AA makes a significant impact in giving folks better chances at life which in turn translates to diversity in every facet of work, society, life in general, which I view is a good thing.

But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general. In my own experience (anecdotal, totally not data science driven), I feel like AA in college admissions has hurt friends and family, in a reverse sort of sense.

But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.

Your thoughts?"
bad-fengshui,,"As with anything related to Asians in politics, I'm seeing a lot of non-asian people telling us what we should do and how we should feel.

Pancake_muncher,,"Yet colleges will allow alumni and doners in easily without considering merit, which make up about 40% of an ivy league school. The system will remain skewed for the rich and powerful while the rest are distracted fighting for scraps."
suberry,,"I just hated Affirmative Action as a distraction and a bandaid from multiple failed systems.

Why are we trying to fix a problem at the *end* of the line? The problem is that Black/Latino students aren't graduating high school with the skills to be competitive for college. And note I said skills, not grades, because GPA is subjective bullshit and I've known 3.0 GPA kids from competitive schools who could run circles around 4.0 kids at shitty schools.

If colleges aren't getting competitive applicants, why should they have to change their methodology to make up for the broken K-12 system? Why are we pointing a finger at colleges when we should be pointing at K-12?

And so now what? Affirmative Action is not legal, but colleges will continue to artificially create a diverse environment by twisting their acceptance process until they get the result people want. And so do we continue to ignore the giant elephant in the room of what the fuck is wrong with K-12?"
Puzzled-Painter3301,,"My own feeling is that I was never in love with affirmative action, because it's not possible to give a preference for one group without implicitly making it harder for another group, but I supported it because I support diversity in higher education. When I applied to college I avoided applying to schools that were 90% white. I also believe that I benefited from it, because I was a first-generation college student. Affirmative action isn't just about helping black students.

I also think that in the grand scheme of things, affirmative action is only used in very selective colleges (where there are probably more valedictorians with perefct test scores than there are spots), and not where most people go to school which is community college and big state universities, which are not very selective and mainly pick based on grades, test scores, etc. Honestly, most community colleges/universities will select you if you can pay and I wish people would stop obsessing over Harvard.

I think that admissions officers do have racial biases and that these won't go away no matter what happens with affirmative action. Anti-Asian racism won't go down as a result of the ruling.

I also think that overall the general support for diversity initiatives in the workplace is a good thing (overall) and that's something this ruling won't affect."

You'll really only find far-left progressives try to paint this as as polarized issue. Just because the head of SFFA is a conservative litigant activist does not mean you're part of the GOP because you hold the same stance of being against affirmative action

I know people will say ""but why don't anti-affirmative action types care about legacies??"" The truth is most of us want to see legacy preferences done away with, but there is no grounds within the Constitution to sue a private university for engaging in legacy preference.

In fact, in the oral arguments for this case, [**Harvard defended their practice of legacy/donor preference when SFFA brought up that eliminating it would increase diversity**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/11/1/legacy-admissions-scotus/)**.**

Now that race-based affirmative action is struck down, it's no longer tenable for higher institutions like Harvard to act like they meaningfully care about diversity while having an  inherently inequitable preference for legacy/donor applicants."
ShalomHasaeyo,,"I think this is great news for our nation. While we’re at it, we should also abolish legacy admission and admission of children of wealthy donors. 

I’m a firm believer on meritocracy and equality for all. 

The push we as a nation should be focusing on is for quality and accessible early childhood education for all, regardless of socioeconomic level, which has decades of data showing it pays dividends on a student’s academic life and beyond. 

By the end of HS or college, the attempt at a boost comes too late, often with underperforming students flunking and dropping out of schools they were unqualified for, while creating racial tensions for obvious reasons. Suppressing and oppressing one group to lift another isn’t the answer."
SteadfastEnd,,"My main concern is that, since the Court did not strike down *Grutter* outright, universities are simply going to find a dozen other, more indirect, insidious ways to continue discriminating against Asian applicants. They won't come right out and say it, but they'll do things like award 'admission points' to applicants of other races who write application essays about how they faced anti-black, anti-Hispanic, anti-native-American discrimination, but award no points or in fact even deduct points for students who write about how they faced anti-Asian discrimination.

Even in its ruling, the Supreme Court clarified in its majority opinion that universities can still consider race in admissions when an applicant highlights his or her racial difficulties in their personal background life story. It's not hard to see how universities can and will manipulate this."

It's been a while since I've been in college and went through the application process. Like many others, I identified my reaches and safety choices. Do people really make such a big deal about not getting into their reaches?

I have no problem with Asians doing what's best for Asians. Nobody else is going to have our best interests in mind. It shouldn't be on anyone to put their interests behind others."

pal2002,,I’m sure selective schools like Harvard will find new and innovative ways to discriminate against Asians - but AT LEAST they can’t do a “-20 points for being Asian” in their formula anymore. And perhaps many schools will not. And overall I do consider this a win.
Ok-Value5827,,"TBH, I don't know the depth of how affirmative actions or college admissions work. However, I don't think this would necessarily stop negative biases against Asians, if there are any.

j3ychen,Taiwanese,"People can continue to debate the legal implications all day long. Plenty of pundits and politicians to look to for emotional responses.

My prediction is, like some others have said, there will be minimal practical changes in admission results.

But, when I read in the Opinion (1) an affirmation that race should not be used as “a stereotype or a negative” and (2) acknowledgement that racial categories are opaque and incoherent, I did feel seen. And it did feel good.

Then that feeling went right away when the Obamas tweeted."
HappyPineapple11,,"The only issue with affirmative action was that it was not explicit enough. If there was a quota system that simply mandated x% of any class had to be an URM paired with a system that minimized the subjective influence of the admission officer and the rest of the chips fall where may, that would be far more tolerable. Instead, we have this bullshit about personality scores that give admission officers the freedom to discriminate and favor any group as they please. 

This ruling doesn't seem to have affected any of that so the actual material impact seems like it'll be quite limited. I haven't looked at the ruling in enough detail, but I am extremely curious if these rulings mentioned anything about the usage of ""personality scores"". The really critical moment in this entire case was Alito asking the Harvard lawyer Waxman why Asian Americans get worse personality scores than everyone else. Waxman basically gave a self contradictory answer of ""we do it to triage applicants (that is, quickly reject them) but it doesn't matter"". The critical issue of discrimination against Asian Americans as a matter of policy seems to have been entirely dodged."
alandizzle,I'm Asian. Hi.,"You know what I hate?

The main subreddits where certain white people are now rally-crying for asians, clearly using us as a fucking political football to further their agenda of pushing brown and blacks further down.

They don't give a fuck about asians, they just want to use us. And I hate that certain asian americans fail to see that.

Now, I'm mixed about affirmative action. Because I do believe that elite universities should be more diverse, but at the same time, I also recognize that race is a murky factor. Affirmative action does NOT have POC quota's, it just takes into account race for the applicant. That's not the same as a quota. So for folks who say that this rids of a race quota, you're wrong. Full stop.

Would a socio-economic factor be better? I've seen zip codes float around as a solution.

There certainly would be bad actors who could game the system, but perhaps that's a better approach?

Anyways, I'm just rambling and using this as an excuse to not work.

edit: just wrapped up a work meeting, and wanted to get more thoughts out.

https://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/reardon_white_paper.pdf

This academic paper suggests (emphasis mine, where SES = socio-economic status)

>Second, while it has been argued that affirmative action can lead to academic mismatch for
minority students, **we find no evidence that this is a systematic result of affirmative action
policies.** Moderate levels of race- and/or SES-based affirmative action appear unlikely to
result in high-achieving minority or low-SES students enrolling, on average, in colleges
where their academic preparation was below the average level for the college they enrolled
in. Similarly, we find that affirmative action has little effect on the average academic
preparation of students in the colleges of the typical White and high-SES student

Additionally: 

>Until racial disparities in educational preparation are eliminated, then, other strategies are
needed. **Our analysis here suggests that affirmative action policies based on socioeconomic
status are unlikely to achieve meaningful increases in racial diversity. That is not to say that
socioeconomic affirmative action would not be valuable in its own right—it would increase
socioeconomic diversity on university campuses and would benefit low-income college
applicants—but only that it is not an effective or efficient means to achieving racial diversity.**
Race-conscious affirmative action does, however, increase racial diversity effectively at the
schools that use it. Although imperfect, it may be the best strategy we currently have. 



so to my earlier point. I DO FUNDAMENTALLY believe that educational institutes should be diverse. An educated society is a net benefit, I think we can all agree to that, right?"
gamesrgreat,,"I’m not a fan of affirmative action even tho it does help minorities in this country. I recognize this country is deeply unfair due to its history.  

That being said, it was a little difficult psychologically being a great student and knowing top universities look at my race as undesirable. For that reason alone I am glad for Asian Americans to see this change. But realistically speaking I doubt it does anything significant to help the Asian American community or our acceptance rates to top universities"
jademing4,Deaf Asian,"If we really want to be fair, let's strike down legacy admissions as well as admissions for athletes and children of donors and faculty, since they make up 43% of white students at selective universities. These universities are not a meritocracy until we address legacy admissions. Getting rid of affirmative action (which I think is wrong to do) without even addressing these nepotistic admissions is ridiculous. Only then will I believe that these activists genuinely are acting in the interest of Asian Americans and other minorities."
xlsma,,"I always say, if an immigrant family of 3 or 4 can come to the United States with only a few hundred dollars (or less) in their pocket, working an underpaid position, and not really speaking English for the first couple years, but still have to do significantly better in academic and extracurricular activities than those who were born here, speaking English from day 1, and have access to public education, simply because of skin color, it's discrimination and racism.

""After Affirmative Action Ends""  -New Yorker

https://archive.fo/gsEkW

In 2013, the Court, in Fisher v. University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the state’s public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants’ race."
Sea5115,,"I largely agree with this:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html)

In practice, affirmative action at elite universities is done at the expense of Asian Americans, and so it had to be done away with.   


Many people have been marginalized, including Asian Americans, over time.  So the supreme court is requiring them to find a system that finds diverse candidates without disadvantaging Asian Americans."
memorychasm,,"There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). 

At the same time, removing AA seems like a ""duh"" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.

When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.

Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that ""Harvard graduates must be the best."" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely. Will colleges still find some way to increase diversity? Of course, as they should. But soon it won't be by something as seemingly facile as race. 

Nothing suggests that today's ruling will change anything under the table for Asian Americans either, and the optics of the AsAm community being used as a political football are totally problematic. But oh well, it's still a step in the right direction."
nycraylin,,"Have they also gotten rid of donation based legacy admissions too? Because otherwise this is just a smokescreen. Meritocracy has always been a joke and heavily discussed in the book the myth of meritocracy as a satire of aristocracy. It's been adopted because it falls in line with American exceptionalism and the American dream. So trying to fix this, means they put the target onto other people. Don't pay attention to all the rich kids getting to pay their way in. Look at all the ethnic groups getting in because how unfair that is to the Asian students that try so hard. 

It sucks because you realize that you can do everything right, literally play by all the rules they set up, excel at them and still not succeed due to no fault of your own. And that's just life. I know most of us grew up thinking and believing in a just world. But we are proven time and time again, that it's not the case. 

Just world fallacy
"" the cognitive bias that assumes that ""people get what they deserve"" – that actions will have morally fair and fitting consequences for the actor. ""

Affirmative action is an attempt to try and change an old boys club. Is it perfect? No, hardly. But to make the enemy other minorities without looking at who holds the institutional power is short sighted and exactly the narrative the people who control policy want you to keep looking at."
hannibal567,,"Some thoughts from a different place on earth if you abide my outside perspective:


Choosing someone for a position/university spot based on ""race"" or gender is inherently racist/discriminatory, I have a hard time seeing how this complies with the fundaments of law and equality. (Is it a continuation/progress of the civil right movement to use discrimination to combat ""perceived"" injustices? Wouldn't it be better to tear down the walls of inequality and unite those who stand for common rights and freedoms against those who seek power to use systems for their advantage/ideologies/etc?

Is it fair to implement an unjust system to combat a different unjust system? (eg. rich white Americans buying their way into colleges) Is this fair for eg. white Americans coming from very low income households from the Midwest or somewhere, in communities where maybe all forms of drug addictions are common and ""schools don't offer the best education""? Would it be fair to give a black American from a wealthy background the advantage solely based on skin colour?

How do Asian Americans feel about (American) notions of ""race"" in contrast to ethnicity? How much in common have eg. People of Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Phillipino origin to each other to feel and speak as a group? How much do you feel (culturally) united or share struggles? (not against it, but it can be misused to nourish ""group think"" "" You are part of my group, help me in my cause/crusade!"")

Are the tests as basis for entrance to colleges enough? Or can they be played and engineered? eg. learning exactly for tests while maybe lacking skills in critical thought or empathy? How much does performance in tests correlate to good academic performances?

How come black American struggle so much while coming partially from similar low income households as Asian Americans? What issues do they face? What skills/systems/schools/social structures need to be created/supported/etc.? How far should groups be supported in the name of diversity and why? Shouldn't we work on giving poor people independent of skin colour fair chances of success? Wouldn't it be better to work on better schools, fair laws/institutions/police/healthcare/working chances, affordable good funded universities, fair wages and worker rights? (not being forced to work overtime etc.) (trying to create a system where the will of voters mean sth and not just the one of mainly businesses/rich)

Why does it seem impossible to implement fair, open and affordable colleges? How come they are in such positions of power to play the game how they like? Wouldn't it be better to fight massive wealth inequality and media powerplays? Fair courts and law making (representing the will of the people)?

How would any injustice be combated in the US through ""more diversity"" if we favour another? Why not fight any injustice/discrimination where it is? Why not seek answers for societal issues? Why not found independent of politics/parties big social movements for all Americans (or enough) (eg. fair wages movement, fair courts, peoples rights to sue companies for causing environmental disasters)? Trying to get your rights, your freedoms, living wages back?

Supposedly high school counselors tell white students that they’ll never be good enough because of affirmative action but it’s funny because every minority parent has sat their kid down and told them that they need to work 3 times as hard to be seen as good compared to an average white person.

Trying rectify inequality through college admission is too late. These disparities should to be addressed far before high school juniors start filling out applications.

But addressing those disparities is expensive and requires multiple systemic changes, so it's easier to convince you that the fault all lies with how college admissions decide who to  accept over others.

Work everyone up into a righteous frothing rage over perceived discrimination and they won't think to wonder why there are so many unprepared and uncompetitive students graduating high school in the first place. None of us would care if black and brown students tested and scored at the same level as whites and Asians."

twerklovr23,,"I support affirmative action in theory, especially since many PoC groups (including many SE asians and Pacifica groups) are underrepresented.

I also don't like Edward Blum and think that he's using asians as pawns.

However, the implementation of affirmation action used by universities was undeniable extremely racist towards Asians, including the underrepresented ones. Lower personality scores and forcing Asians to hide their ""asian-ness"" is such blatant discrimination, it sounds like satire.

Even worse was the gaslighting and vilification of Asians by ""liberals"" against anyone in our community who dared speak out against this discrimination, even by our own community.

And despite the obvious problem that is legacy admissions, conservatives and liberals (who only every brought up the issue when defending affirmative action) are just going to let it slide bc rich and power people on both sides don't want to lose a crumb of their advantage in the world.

SufficientTill3399,,"While it’s true that legacy admissions are a grave injustice to merit-based admissions at private colleges and universities, and the fact is that they are a major issue at one of the schools (Harvard) named in the lawsuit, the fact is that UNC was also practicing anti-Asian academic racism (and let’s be honest, that’s literally what race-based affirmative action in schools amounts to, and if something has a racist effect like that then it’s no less racist than K-12 inequities are to Blacks and Hispanics) without any legacy admissions involved. Thus, while UNC has been getting less publicity than Harvard, the fact is that legacy admissions are being used as a red herring to obscure the fact that racial justice was achieved for the most forgotten Americans (Asian-Americans). This is especially true because the court was not asked to consider legacy admissions.

If the court was indeed asked to consider legacy admissions as well, then I would agree with all the people decrying the ruling. Unfortunately, I cannot side with any of them because however small, we have to realize this is a victory for racial justice. We cannot punish those who still manage to succeed in the face of institutionalized white privilege in the name of advancing those who suffer long-term effects of slavery and Jim Crow (Blacks) and/or those who were absorbed by military conquest and faced less well-known Jim Crow-type situations (Hispanics). Moreover, the court did rule that colleges and universities are still allowed to consider a student’s observations on how race affected their life, without using race itself as a deciding factor for admissions.

Lastly, the strongest arguments that have been made in favor of affirmative action are ultimately those rooted in economics more than race. A person whose family paid for SAT tutoring has an unfair advantage over a poor kid who flips burgers after school to feed a broken family, and this is a bigger obstacle than color or facial structure even when being dark leads to unfair police profiling. Let affirmative action be based wholly or primarily on family socioeconomic status, otherwise the biggest beneficiaries will be wealthy Black and Latino kids more than those affirmative action purports to help-and let legacy admissions be challenged in a separate lawsuit for effectively functioning as affirmative action for the generationally-wealthy."

It's also important that the student body of the college to be diverse because it simulates the real world and allows people to experience different perspectives.

compstomper1,,"Here's a contrarian opinion:

I am for affirmative action. Why? 

Let's take a look at medical school admission. The number of slots is largely limited to the # of residency slots (funded by medicare). So it's a zero-sum game. For every white med school student is one fewer latinx med school student. For every azn med school student is one fewer black med school student. [We know that black med school students aren't as ""competitive"" as their azn counterparts](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race#part-2-medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race). (i'm too lazy to calculate confidence intervals after 5pm). 

However, [we also know that in areas with black doctors, black residents have better health outcomes](https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/14/black-doctors-primary-care-life-expectancy-mortality/#:~:text=Other%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,blood%20tests%20and%20flu%20shots.) So in using a utilitarian argument for maximizing public health, we *should* maximize the # of black medical students. Yes, they should be academically capable of finishing med school and passing the boards (as a dropout is a wasted slot). So sorry Sarah Chen with a 4.0 GPA from Stanford, maybe we shouldn't let you in so we can let a black student in."

Admiral_Wen,,">But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.

I understand where the conflicted feelings come from. But the more I think about this, the more I agree with that 76%. There are 2 main arguments in favor of affirmative action:

1. Race heavily intersects with socioeconomic class. Many underrepresented minority groups are disproportionately poor, which places them at a disadvantage.
2. Diversity is important in education, and race is part of that.

For 1, if the argument is that race intersects with socioeconomic class, then we should be implementing affirmative action *based on* socioeconomic class. After all, there are many poor families of Asian/Indian descent, for example. And not all black/latino families are poor. Implementing a socioeconomic based affirmative action system would be far more beneficial to poorer communities compared to reducing applicants to a race checkbox.

For 2, I do agree that diversity is important in education. But I've always doubted that colleges truly cared about diversity. In reality universities consistently admit from the same wealthy families, the same elite circles, race notwithstanding. So while race-based admissions can *appear* to bring diversity on the surface, it does little to bring a genuine diversity of perspectives, experiences, and viewpoints. Which is all the more reason to move to a economic class based system. (Jay Caspian Kang says it well in his [2022 opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/affirmative-action-harvard.html): ""What do 'diversity' and 'equity' really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1% as from the bottom 20?"")

And of course, all of this become even more questionable when you consider that many of these schools have admissions policies towards Asians that are suspicious at best. The completely opaque ""personality scores"", the higher test scores required, etc. I think we're lying to ourselves if we say that there's been no bias at all against Asian applicants, even if not with outright malicious intent.

So in short, I do believe that diversity is important, from classrooms to boardrooms to athletics fields. But I think that there are far better ways of achieving it. In fact, the current race-based system used by colleges just feels lazy, not to mention how much it hides the massive *lack* of diversity on campuses. Going forward, I'd like to see schools actually reach out to lower income communities, contribute towards underfunded schools, and be less influenced by wealthy, powerful elites."
Chidling,,"Most ethnic groups widely approve of AA in the abstract but have a mixed to negative opinions on that exact question. 

I think in the same pew survey or a different one, most groups react negatively when asked if colleges should consider race/ethnicity in college admissions."
,,">But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.

Me neither. People are forgetting that this ruling is a gateway to an attack on any D&I initiatives, including ones designed to help Asians, who are very underrepresented once you leave elite colleges or entry-level white-collar professional jobs.

If one is okay with Affirmative Action going away, then you are okay with Asian under-representation elsewhere because it's the exact same logic, e.g. Why should A24 take on traditionally underrepresented Asian stories? Why use race in determining which movie to be made? Why should Michelle Yeoh win an best actress Oscar just because an Asian has never received one? Why should Biden have a diverse cabinet?

Imagine if a major Hollywood studio had a program/workshop for Asian-American writers to bring in traditionally underrepresented voices in film/TV. Are people here against that? By the same logic of being against AA, you would have to be against such programs."

Sufficient_Carrot535,,"> I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general

Yes, yes it is. Don’t listen to racists who say “colleges are already 30% Asian, there’s no negative impact of affirmative action” or even “there need to be less Asians in colleges.” That is a logical fallacy that assumed Asian applicants have the same scores as everyone else; if Asian applicants have significantly higher scores than everyone else, then they should get in more than everyone else.

As the other poster said, once California banned AA, colleges shot up to 40-50% Asian."
negative_timezone,,">As an Asian (not born in the US but pretty much assimilated here for 35+ years), I am conflicted.

Vegetable_War335,,"This is subtle racism. Black and Hispanic students DO have the skills to be competitive for college. I had a 1450 without studying SAT, going to the worst schools in my area. In fact I went to a continuation schools. And no 3.0 kid anywhere was running circles around me because I had actual intellect. 

With a 1450 score my high school counselor still told me I shouldn’t try to apply to a UC. I as a literal child had to tell this person: I have a 1450 and a 3.8, what makes you think I can’t go to a UC and do well? 

What Asian Americans don’t take into consideration is how vastly racism, poverty, and discrimination impact children in school. Luckily my teachers knew me and knew that I deserved a lot better than what I was being told was my limit because of where I lived and the poor social economic status. But I was classified as gifted in the second grade and was taking algebra courses early. 
I also played four different instruments. I grew up in that severely abusive home and all of these extracurriculars and things that I  was doing I had to do on my own because my parents either didn’t care or didn’t have the time. 

At what point was I lacking the skills? 

At no point. And this is what affirmative action is meant to address the lack opportunity that is faced by many students simply because of their racial and economic background. 

Until a person has lived a life experience where they are talented and intelligent but still told to aim for less because the opportunities are simply nonexistent in their environment then I don’t think that people know the true effects of affirmative action.

This was years ago and things have improved. My nephews were able to take AP classes and participate in tons of activities. I know 10 Hispanic students from my same neighborhood who were accepted into Ivy Leagues.

Sometimes I really wonder about the quality of individuals that Harvards undergrad program produces...

I remember the Shark Tank episode of that lady who supposedly graduated top of her class at Harvard who had some subscription service for early-childhood development toys. It was a decent idea and she had 3 of the sharks on board for her, but she kept trying to argue with them over the ownership/royalty split; one shark asked for 15% ownership she'd argue that they only get 7.2%, another would ask for 8% ownership plus royalties and she'd offer 7.6% with royalties.

By the end, all 3 sharks rescinded their offers because is was clear that she was just arguing for the sake of arguing and that she only cared workshopping a deal rather than running an actual business.

100%... My Japanese mom from Japan can name all the ivy league schools which is kind of weird and sad because it's really not the most important thing in life. When 30% of kids make it to Ivy leagues because of legacy, it's hard to view it as anything more than an elite rich boy club that just has a really good PR firm. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the education is good, you can get research opportunities or bushiness connections, but you can also be successful at any major universities in the US.

jademing4,Deaf Asian,"I absolutely agree with you, affirmative action is a step towards the right path, but it is not a perfect solution, and universities need to take further steps to address inequality in their campus. They merely provide a way to get students' foot in the door, but once in, students will still face issues. This has been a major reason in why students of color tend to drop out or transfer at a higher rate compared to white students. Furthermore, with universities placing a greater emphasis on racial affirmative action, and less emphasis on socio-economic background, many students of color that are accepted in highly selective universities tend to come from similar upper-class backgrounds. That being said, getting rid of racial based affirmative action won't solve any problems, and will probably only make them worse.

I am quite concerned that this decision will lead to striking down diversity initiatives in the workplace though, now that this decision set a precedent."

Ultimately we ask ourselves, what is the purpose of an college degree; fro what I can tell it's supposed to be a document of the ability to learn, research information, and apply it to applicable scenarios. But if all that practically means is that the student is able to learn something long enough to spit it on to a test paper, why do we need university institutions for that?

Why not gather the various curriculums of the various university undergrad programs and implement them into a system like Khan Academy?

At the end of the day, Asians need to put Asians first. That is what every other marginalized community does. Are black people shamed for not prioritizing women’s rights before their own? Are women shamed for not prioritizing LGBT rights before their own? No they aren’t, and it’s ridiculous that Asian Americans are convinced they shouldn’t look out for their own rights first. As we’ve seen from covid, nobody cares about us. Don’t fall for the propaganda that we’re white adjacent—we’re not white, we’re not black, we’re Asian.

During covid, hate crimes against Asians went up 6-7x. Especially against women and our elders. No marches or movements for them. You mention the disproportionate violence against Asian women—Asian women are the only women who actually experience more violence from men outside of their race than within it. Asian businesses lost $7 billion because of racism. No movement to support Asian-owned businesses. So many Asians are living in poverty like you say—Asians are even the poorest race in New York. All of these things happen and Asians wonder why nobody supports us and it’s obvious—because we don’t even support ourselves first!

If we want positive change for Asian Americans we have to start putting ourselves first. And that has to do with (1) stop shaming other Asians for supporting things that *help* Asians and (2) learning more Asian history. We are a marginalized group. The history of Asians in America is bloody, but the vast majority of Asian Americans literally do not know their history. We need to stop acting like we don’t deserve rights because we’re “not minority enough”."

2ndStaw,,"For me personally, I think it should depend on the community the institution declares it wishes to serve.

Let's say we have a university that claims to serve the entire natiom, so the community is made of the very rich 0.1%, middle next 30%, and the rest is poor or poverty line. If their class size is 1000 they get to admit only 1 very rich person. Of course economic status is a gradient, and to prevent the tragedy of the cutoff we will consider upper-middle (2%?), middle (30%), and the transitional lower-middle (40%?), and lower class (69.9%).

Note that the percentage added up to more than 100%, that's because the upper/middle/lower quota is one strict requirement, (0.1/30/69.9), with another strict requirement of 2%(?) transitional upper-middle whose income range covers the lower part of the upper class and the upper part of the middle class. Similarly the transitional 40%(?) lower-middle which covers the lower part of the middle class and the upper part of the lower class is also a strict requirement. This should prevent people from feeling cheated by having like $100 more income than the cutoff line, since they belong mainly to the transitional quota.

These quotas are strict, and other criteria are considered after. Universities are free to choose the community they serve to game the percentage, provided that they declare it very clearly with statistical data to support. I think it's fair that they get controlled by their own rhetoric. It should also be easier and more justifiable to balance race and score while satisfying this process.

Edit: mathematical explanation.
There's 7 variables, x1, x2, y1, y2, y3, z1, z2.

x1+x2 = 0.1%

y1+y2+y3 = 30%

z1+z2 = 69.9%

In a hypothetical scenario, imo it would be totally OK for AA in higher education if Asian-Americans reciprocally received positive discrimination in underrepresented industries.

This is entirely subjective. I think the Asians who no longer get rejected due to their race would disagree with you.

You mention black classmates being better for learning about European colonialism and slavery. You realize that black people aren’t the only ones knowledgeable about this right? And you realize that most black students at elite institutions are 2nd gen Africans and have never had American slavery in their family right?

Black people are not the only victims of white supremacy. And it’s especially wild that you would choose to do this at the expense of Asians, who’ve also been victims.

DJIisStupid,,wonder how this is split between income levels and migration timelines
,,"Very interesting that the split for affirmative action among Chinese-Americans is basically between the southern Chinese (Cantonese, Fujianese) aka the “Chinatown Chinese” and the other mainland Chinese. As a Cantonese person, I didn’t grow up in Chinatown but I did grow up Chinatown adjacent with working-class parents. The southern Chinese have been in the US longer and maybe more supportive of affirmative action because their kids are older and done with college? Just conjecture on my part. Also, there isn’t that much solidarity between various Chinese groups. I know my parents routinely make fun of non-Cantonese Chinese people and I’m sure non-Cantonese Chinese mock the Cantonese. The joke is that all non-Cantonese people are considered “northerners” to them with Canton/Guangdong being one of the most southern provinces.

EDIT: I also think kids of the southern Chinese are more likely to be 2nd generation and older in the US and more likely to support affirmative action, compared to more recent northern Chinese immigrants."
JesusSinfulHands,,"Taken from this [story](http://aapidata.com/blog/asianam-affirmative-action-surveys/), written by Karthick Ramakrishnan and Janelle Wong, two professors who study Asian-American issues:

>> Support for affirmative action has declined dramatically among Chinese Americans over a relatively short period of four years, while it has remained stable among other Asian Americans.[3] The growing activism and opposition to affirmative action among Chinese immigrants has been well documented by scholars like Oiyan Poon, Karthick Ramakrishnan, Jenn Fang, and others, and we will continue to explore this topic in future blog posts.

http://aapidata.com/blog/asianam-affirmative-action-surveys/

I've read [elsewhere](https://supchina.com/2017/06/14/split-heart-chinese-america/) that this issue represents a [split](http://reappropriate.co/2018/05/reconnecting-heart-and-head-racism-immigration-policy-wechat-and-chinese-americans/) between recent Chinese immigrants and Chinese-Americans who have been around for a while. Do you all think this is accurate?"
,,"Frankly as a ABC currently in college, I have recently reversed my opinion on Affirmative Action. I more so subscribe to Justice Robert's opinion on the matter: any discrimination on race, whether good or bad, is still ultimately discrimination. 

Race-based affirmative action is often propped up by good intentions but produces faulty results. i.e Asian Americans end up being discriminated the most despite being a minority. In reality, a strictly *economical* version of affirmative actions would be significantly better and would achieve the same results of alleviating the structural injustices of black, brown, and yellow communities."
ohea,,"Easy. It's overwhelmingly coming from people with recent Mainland backgrounds, who grew up in an effectively mono-ethnic society where a grueling battery of standardized tests are the deciding factor of a child's worth. Not least because it's widely believed that any subjective standard would just be used as a way for the well-connected to gain unfair advantages (走后门，拉关系，etc). They come to America with that mindset and life experience, plus they generally have little or no knowledge of the history of racial injustice in America but have often been influenced by American media's negative portrayals of black people.

It's a mix of suspicion towards any selection criteria that isn't essentially mathematical, a sense of being 'in competition' with other immigrant and minority groups, plus a fair bit of prejudice. And Anglo right-wingers are perfectly happy to take advantage of this for their own purposes."
Barebacking_Bernanke,Support Your Local Asian American Businesses,The decline neatly coincides with the effort to defeat [revisions to SC-5 that would have allowed for AA at the state's universities.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_California_Proposition_209#Attempted_revision_in_2012) There was a grassroots movement among the state's Chinese American population to defeat the measure and it was seen as one of their earliest political successes. I'm sure Chinese media on the West Coast covered it extensively as well.
,,I think affirmative action specifically hurts Chinese and Indian Americans the most because they’re the wealthiest and highest performing Asian groups in the US
rubey419,,"As a Filipino American I can see the reasons for the divergence. I went to a top 10 grad school in the US. The campus was ~25% Asian and yet I was pretty much the only Filipino person there, either from the Philippines or a first/second/third generation descendent. Filipinos are amongst the highest Asian populations in the US and yet had no representation at my elite school.


Edit: according to 2010 census, Filipinos are second only to the Chinese for Asian populations in the US by ethnicity. 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Asian_Americans#Population

KillMeFastOrSlow,,"This is ironic because my white friends blamed me for using affirmative action to unfairly get into a third tier college 20 years ago and I’m chinese. Without affirmative action the schools would be lily white and the H1B program wouldn’t exist, according to most people."
Tokidoki_Haru,Chinese-American 🇹🇼 華人,"I believe the divide is largely dependent on the amount of time spent in the United States, and the understanding of race relations. Both of my parents arrived in the US as university students in the 80s, from Taiwan and Malaysia. Both they, and their social circles, are largely supportive of affirmative action as an avenue for the disadvantaged to break out of the cycle of poverty and illiteracy. At the same time, they still maintain a heavy emphasis on personal initiative to get ahead in life.

At the same time, there are my friend's parents who are from Mainland China, arriving within the last 20 years or so, who fervently reject affirmative action as disadvantaging their own children. In Northern Virginia, this is attitude is especially pronounced. Thomas Jefferson School of Science and Technology was a designated magnate school, which requires students to take an admissions exam.This results in wildly skewed student demographics, with 70% Asian, 20% White, and the remainder an assorted mix of everyone else. [Source for the latest statistics here](http://schoolprofiles.fcps.edu/schlprfl/f?p=108:108:1577146908837::NO::P0_CURRENT_SCHOOL_ID,P0_EDSL:300,0) This high school is a mark of prestige and opportunity, directly feeding to Ivy Leagues or the University of Virginia. 

That 10% is routinely protested by the Asian and White community as merely diversity and affirmative action seats. The students that do go there have developed a reputation across the entire FCPS system as not only as snobs, but also highly racist and elitist as well. Certainly not conducive to the attitude of civic and social integration which the rest of the school system as a whole promotes."
ATF2GTalon,,"The dislike between Northern and Southern (Cantonese) goes back many centuries in China.  Southern China was treated as a place where criminals, corrupt officials, and rivals were exiled to during Imperial times.   Over time Northerners just came to look down on anyone from Southern China.  And even worse they disliked anyone that spoke Cantonese.  When the Communists took over they continued the persecution and imprisonment of many Cantonese people.  Most Cantonese people fled China during these times to Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, USA, UK, etc, just to escape the Communists and certain death.  That's why most of the early established Chinese communities in foreign countries were predominantly Cantonese.  

Sorry for off topic, but now back on topic.  I'm probably older than most people here.  I'm 42 y/o ABC and I don't support Affirmative Action.  I believe in hard work, and earning it based on merit.  A lot of the Mainland Chinese are definitely smart enough to get into the best schools, but they lack the hard work and just want shortcuts.  They have a sense of entitlement especially the international students.  As a parent myself now, I teach my kids to work hard and if they want something they have to do the work.  There are no shortcuts, there are no free rides."

The cantonese students usually ended up hanging out with the other viets and sometimes koreans. We've really got a long way to go in terms of pan asian solidarity if even subgroups of Chinese people can't get along with each other, let alone historically conflicted groups like japanese and chinese/koreans. 

Also it's sad how these more recent immigrants are targeting their efforts towards the wrong group of people. Perhaps they don't understand the dynamics in america as well as those who were 3rd or 4th gen. Go after the whites instead of the other minorities. I'm not anti-AA but I'd absolutely understand why chinese people would be pissed with the possibility of being held to a higher standard than privileged white people. Take a cue from the Jewish back in 1920s and fight against the whites as anti-racists instead of targeting another group of oppressed people and risk being labeled as the racists."

I hate to say this and I do want to see more solidarity, but a lot of times when Cantonese people make fun of non-Cantonese people it is often also directed at other poorer southern Chinese who make up the majority of migrant laborers in Guangdong. 

No the debate is not between southern Chinese and non-southern Chinese, but Chinese people from poorer regions vs wealthier regions.

Chinese people are trained to be vary of any vagueness in metrics that's usually used to hide corruption and favoritism. Speaking anecdotally of my own family's experience, my uncle did well enough on his gaokao to get into Qinghua in the 70s. This was the first wave of gaokao after colleges reopened after the Cultural revolution and it was a huge deal. However, the admissions office said that he wasn't a member of the GQT (youth division of the CCP) so he didn't display enough ""leadership qualities"", and a person who was a dangyuan was selected instead of him.

I have been to China over 100 times in the past 13 years.  I have been to many cities, museums, etc.  I have many friends and colleagues in China who have also told me some of the Chinese history and things that happened when they were kids.

akong_supern00b,,">Sure, Guangdong and Fujian might be two of the wealthiest provinces but it doesn’t mean the immigrants coming here were wealthy

For sure.  It's surprising for me that people consider Fujianese people (in the US) to be wealthy when the Fujianese community around me growing up (in NY for the most part) was overwhelmingly working class people.  People like my parents (who actually went FJ to HK to US, as did many others in our circles) and various relatives came as restaurant workers or store clerks so their kids could eventually get white collar jobs (or own/take over the restaurant when they're old enough). I have relatives that have done well for themselves, but none that were wealthy before immigrating here.

Maybe it depends what part of FJ we're talking about.  For us, it was not at all surprising to hear workers at a Chinese takeout or a cheap sushi/Thai/Asian fusion place speaking to each other in Fuzhou dialect.

>So given there are more Filipinos in California, why the large over representation of Chinese to Filipinos at UC Berkeley / system?

I don't know and it's not relevant. The entire justification for affirmative action is to deal with white supremacy, not Chinese supremacy. Filipinos are (slightly) over-represented both relative to whites and the entire population - I don't see how a university using AA policies even with Asians disaggregated would have any positive effect (at best) on Filipinos; in fact, why even the concern about Chinese over-representation?

>here weren’t many Chinese Americans originally from and living in North Carolina either, so IMO can’t compare Filipinos and Chinese students originally from the southeast attending Duke because there weren’t many to begin with.

It's not because of North Carolina - it's because of the East Coast/midwest presence.  Chinese American demographics are shifted significantly more ""east"" than Filipinos.  59+% of the Filipino-American population lives in the Western US (CA, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada).  It's closer to 42% for Chinese-Americans.  As one extreme example, NY state Chinese:Filipino ratio is 4x.

If your dad is between 50 to 75 years old, this may have been stories from the cultural revolution or the great leap. My dad is born in Henan and started in primary school in the mid 60s. My great grand parents on his side were considered to be rich peasants and were part of the black class under CCP rule. They were executed in the late 60s after years of imprisonment and struggle sessions, ultimately they were pronounced to be reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries. 

My dad was barred from primary school after his grandparents were taken, and he would travel to a neighboring village where a teacher was kind enough to give lessons to children of the persecuted classes. My grandparents renounced their filial relationship with my grandparents and had to participate in their struggle sessions. They penned the denouncement of my great grand parents, so that my dad could finally go back to primary school.

He also described the years of hunger and famine both before the revolution and the sporadic bouts during. He would describe how he had to eat dirt when he couldn't tolerate the stomach pain, how he and his brothers would fight over grass.

idrawfloorplan,Chinese,"I posted the link to give more context in my reply on the issue of discrimination that the post above mentioned. Sure there are wealthy people from poor southern provinces like mine that are better off than working class families in Fujian or Guangdong, but specific individual cases like this don't matter to the problem of discrimination. It is more about the overall perception of wealth associated with regions in broader Chinese society. I have met many older working class Cantonese who associated people from my home region with some pretty negative stereotypes despite my own achievement (I'm not skilled labor immigrant or h1b but doing okay). Obviously not everyone holds backwards views and my goal wasn't to say that EVERYONE from Guangdong or coastal regions are wealthy, but these regions are wealthy and that is a fact and a major factor in regional discrimination, rather than the simple South/North divide explanation that the other comment suggested that often ignores the experience of southern Chinese from poorer provinces.  

Working class families in provinces where I am from would consider working class families in Guangdong and Fujian to be wealthier than they are. Having a Guangdong hukou is considered a desirable thing for many working class families where I am from. That is not saying people from Fujian or Guangdong don't experience working class struggle or they are not working class or nobody from these regions are poor. But regional differences does matter at least to some degrees when it comes to immigration patterns. Working class families from poorer provinces often didn't have the same opportunities or connection to immigrate as those from wealthier provinces. There is a reason why the overwhelming majority of both wealthy and working class immigrants for many decades are from wealthy coastal regions instead of poorer inland regions, although the immigration pattern at least on the working class family immigration part is slowly changing and I am seeing more working class people from provinces economically similar to mine immigrate here.

For sure the wealthy h1b or skilled workers are definitely more well off than all of us. It actually kinda fits that GDP map I linked considering those cities/regions with very high GDP per capita number are where most of the h1b/skilled workers came from (the wealthy mainlanders everyone is talking about lol)."

Who knows. The support fell so fast (37% in 4 years!) that it could just be a timing thing and broader AA support among Asians might be significantly lower now anyway.  The advocacy passion may come from extreme attentiveness toward education and focus on getting into the best school possible.   Finally, it's important to note the survey itself might be biased.

InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"This is a really excellent article. Since it's behind a paywall, I'm copying it here:

> In the commencement speech that Drew Gilpin Faust, then the president of Harvard, gave in 2009, she interpreted “Veritas,” the university’s motto, as “the commitment to use knowledge and research to penetrate delusion, cant, prejudice, self-interest.” One of the final messages she sent out before stepping down, in June of this year, referred to veritas again, in the mode of crisis management. (I received the message as a Harvard employee and an alumna of its law school.) A civil-rights lawsuit that was filed against Harvard in 2014, alleging that its undergraduate-admissions process discriminates against Asian-Americans, was moving forward in court, and Faust wrote in response, “Harvard will vigorously defend its longstanding values and the processes by which it seeks to create a diverse educational community.” The plaintiff’s portrayal of facts about Harvard would be inaccurate, she claimed, and she was “committed to ensuring that veritas will prevail.” The implication was that Harvard was defending against nothing short of an assault on truth itself.

> The lawsuit, which will go to trial next week in federal district court in Boston, has been called “the Harvard affirmative-action case,” and it has been spoken of as if it could end affirmative action at Harvard and elsewhere. Both the plaintiff, a national group called Students for Fair Admissions, and Harvard benefit from describing it that way, but, in fact, the stakes are somewhat different. Students for Fair Admissions was founded by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who has orchestrated several lawsuits challenging affirmative action, and the initial complaint included a demand that the court declare it illegal to use race as a factor in college admissions. But, in keeping with Supreme Court precedents, the judge in the case, Allison D. Burroughs, has granted judgment in favor of Harvard on that point. The question that remains for trial is whether Harvard has gone beyond what the Supreme Court has said are permissible ways to consider race in admissions—and, specifically, whether it has shown a special bias against Asian-American applicants.

> Documents that came out in discovery in the lawsuit, and which were made public this past summer, revealed some startling facts. In 2013, Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research conducted an internal investigation of race bias in its admissions process and produced reports suggesting that it was biased against Asians. Among the most striking findings was that Asians were admitted at lower rates than whites, even though Asian applicants were rated higher than white applicants in most of the categories used in the admissions process, including academics, extracurriculars, and test scores. One exception was the “personal rating.” According to Harvard, this rating “reflects the wide range of information . . . that bears on applicants’ personal qualities,” and “may shed light on the applicant’s character.” The plaintiff claims that the use of affirmative action does not explain the negative effect on the admissions rate for Asians relative to whites. (Harvard said that its prior analysis was “incomplete, preliminary, and based on limited inputs.”) Warring expert economists retained in this case, both highly respected, interpret the data differently, owing to somewhat arcane disagreements about methodology: one concludes that the admissions rate for Asians is attributable to discrimination, whereas the other concludes that it is not. An unfortunate upshot is that, for Harvard to be right, it must be true that Asian applicants really did have worse personal qualities than white applicants—a suggestion that Harvard officials denied in depositions.

> It has served Harvard’s interest for people to think that, unless it wins this case, affirmative action will be eliminated, and that Harvard’s treatment of Asian-American applicants was necessary to attain an acceptable level of diversity among its undergraduates. The many amicus briefs that have been filed in support of Harvard generally make those assumptions. One brief, filed by sixteen élite universities, including the rest of the schools in the Ivy League, states that if they were “required to adopt race-neutral admissions policies” they “would no longer be able to effectively pursue the attainment of the type of diversity that advances their educational missions.”

> But to understand the stakes of the case, it is important not to conflate two separate concepts: the legal issue of affirmative action and the factual issue of whether Harvard discriminated against one particular racial group. The case against Harvard will be strongest if the allegations about how Asian applicants were evaluated relative to white ones turn out to be true. The defense of Harvard will be strongest if it can demonstrate that there is no way to fulfill the goal of diversity without suppressing Asian applicants relative to white ones to some degree. But answering these key factual questions does not entail upending the consideration of race as a factor in evaluating black or Latino applicants, or other groups that would be unacceptably underrepresented in the absence of race-conscious admissions.

> There are serious questions about the future of affirmative action. The Trump Administration has made clear its preference for race-blind admissions policies, rescinding, in July, the Obama Administration’s guidance encouraging schools to use race-conscious affirmative action. The Department of Justice filed a statement of interest on behalf of the plaintiff in the Harvard lawsuit, emphasizing the Supreme Court’s view, expressed in 2003, that race-based admissions policies must be “temporary.” For affirmative action to remain legally permissible in higher education, it may need the support of the newest Justice, Brett Kavanaugh. In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned on whether he supports using race as a factor in admissions in order to achieve diversity on campuses. His response referred to his work in the White House for George W. Bush, noting that the President “was interested in promoting racial diversity” but “believed in using race-neutral means first.”

> It makes sense that Harvard would try to use the general legality of affirmative action as a shield to defend itself against the ugly and specific allegations of intentional discrimination against Asians. It also makes sense for many Asians to feel hesitant about objecting to being discriminated against, fearing that their objection may jeopardize affirmative action itself. But the dispute that will need to be resolved this fall is about Harvard’s alleged discrimination, not whether affirmative action must go. Harvard’s new president, Lawrence Bacow, issued a message this week recognizing the trial’s potential to create divisions on campus, and urged, “We must be quick to understand and slow to judge.” If veritas demands finding that Harvard has in fact engaged in discrimination against Asians, one can safely root against Harvard and in favor of race-conscious affirmative action at the same time."
hank_scorpiooo,,"This is exactly how I view this case. It's not against affirmative action, it's not about black and brown minorities. It's about how we have been treated unfairly for doing too well. It's about white privilege once again rearing its ugly head. It's about how too many Asians is somehow an issue, but not too many white people. They're keeping Asians down based on an arguably nebulous score called ""personality"" (how do you even measure personality with a number is beyond me).

Stoxastic,,"In my opinion, the anti-asian bias in this case is an unfortunate side effect of affirmative action and race based admissions. 

If you read up on the case presented to the supreme court, Grutter vs. Bollinger, the main argument in favor isn't really about helping underrepresented minorities. The main argument is that a diverse student body helps accomplish the goals of the university and benefits the entire student body. I would agree with this. The SCOTUS ruling ultimately determined that the US Constitution ""does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."" 

With that in mind, we can see that schools can alter admissions policies to combat the ""not enough UR minorities problem."" We all know a black/Hispanic student is going to get admitted before and white student with an identical application. However, it appears that Harvard (and most likely other universities as well) are using this same power granted by the SCOTUS to combat the ""too many Asians problem."" In this case, we see white students now being accepted in front of Asian students.

The intent of accepting more UR minorities is definitely good, unlike the nefarious intent of denying Asian applicants by giving them low personality scores. However, I believe that from a legal standpoint, the university is using the same legal power to accomplish both intents: the legal power to use race as a factor in admissions, as long as you don't have quotas. 

Discrimination against Asian applicants is complete bullshit. But I don't see how you can legally force Harvard and other schools to abolish this policy without completely stripping their ability to use race as a factor in admissions.

I like diverse student bodies, but university officials at Harvard have gone too far to exclude Asian applicants in order to maintain a strong plurality of whiteness in the student body.

I think the phrase ""This is why we can't have nice things"" fits nicely here.

Now, instead of seeing race based admissions to be used to exclude Asians, what if we see it has a way to prop up white applicants. It sounds bullshit but it's just the same policy that applies to black/hispanics, only applied to a different race.

Already read this yesterday and the related discussions on Twitter. When you look at how the opponents of affirmative action are receiving this article, the issue is that as long as affirmative action exists to provide advantage to underrepresented minorities, they want it gone. And they don't won't want to stop until that's the case.

I have the same middle position as you and Suk. But I'm realistic about where the opponents of affirmative action want to go with these cases and what their goals are. And who will be judging this?

There's a theoretical position here that the Supreme Court would only rule on potential anti-asian bias, but what exactly do you see the outcome to be?  How does it get resolved? Will it get rid of legacy and donor preference? Or will they instead rule more broadly on the use of race as a factor itself?

They were denying admission to students who were well above expected standard. They should have gotten in. They didn't need the extra boost from affirmative action. 

>what we've seen in California public schools is an overindexing of Asian people relative to our % of the population and an underindexing of everyone else.

So strict racial quotas are actually illegal. And affirmative action does not necessarily have to be proportional to population size. If that were case, only about 5.5% of the Harvard student body should be Asian. But I agree that we need to make sure that disadvantaged minorities are given an equal playing field. That doesn't have to come at the expense of Asians in this case.

We can break this down like so, the top 50% of students should get in based on merit alone, regardless of race, and ideally legacy. The other 50% should compete with affirmative action boost in effect. Even if this were the system used, Asian students would only make up about 30-40% of the student population. There is still plenty of room to allow other minorities in without compromising merit.

More importantly, **we are a minority**. We are not white. We are succeeding in-spite of white hegemony, not because of it.  **We are not the ones standing in the way of other races**. Our success should be welcomed and celebrated. If they lose this case, this is sets a dark precedence for other minorities. It will say you can do well, just not that well.

Admissions
Meritocracy or Bias?
Study finds that when white people are told of the success of Asian applicants, their commitment to basing admissions on grades and test scores drops.

By Scott Jaschik  
August 13, 2013
140 COMMENTS
 
NEW YORK -- Critics of affirmative action generally argue that the country would be better off with a meritocracy, typically defined as an admissions system where high school grades and standardized test scores are the key factors, applied in the same way to applicants of all races and ethnicities.

But what if they think they favor meritocracy but at some level actually have a flexible definition, depending on which groups would be helped by certain policies? Frank L. Samson, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Miami, thinks his new research findings suggest that the definition of meritocracy used by white people is far more fluid than many would admit, and that this fluidity results in white people favoring certain policies (and groups) over others.

Specifically, he found, in a survey of white California adults, they generally favor admissions policies that place a high priority on high school grade-point averages and standardized test scores. But when these white people are focused on the success of Asian-American students, their views change.

The white adults in the survey were also divided into two groups. Half were simply asked to assign the importance they thought various criteria should have in the admissions system of the University of California. The other half received a different prompt, one that noted that Asian Americans make up more than twice as many undergraduates proportionally in the UC system as they do in the population of the state.

When informed of that fact, the white adults favor a reduced role for grade and test scores in admissions -- apparently based on high achievement levels by Asian-American applicants. (Nationally, Asian average total scores on the three parts of the SAT best white average scores by 1,641 to 1,578 this year.)

When asked about leadership as an admissions criterion, white ranking of the measure went up in importance when respondents were informed of the Asian success in University of California admissions.

""Sociologists have found that whites refer to 'qualifications' and a meritocratic distribution of opportunities and rewards, and the purported failure of blacks to live up to this meritocratic standard, to bolster the belief that racial inequality in the United States has some legitimacy,"" Samson writes in the paper. ""However, the results here suggest that the importance of meritocratic criteria for whites varies depending upon certain circumstances. To wit, white Californians do not hold a principled commitment to a fixed standard of merit.""

Samson raises the idea that white perception of ""group threat"" from Asians influences ideas about admissions criteria -- suggesting that they are something other than pure in their embrace of meritocratic approaches.

He adds: ""While the principle of fairness may be a driving concern in people’s attitudes towards policies such as affirmative action, social welfare, and fair housing, the malleability of white respondents’ attitudes towards the importance of university admissions criteria in response to racial considerations indicates that public opinion about the importance of such criteria is anything but fair, at least if the definition of fairness entails a procedural fairness by which all groups should be subject to the same procedural process, i.e., same weighting of admissions criteria, when determining whether an individual should be admitted to a prestigious public university system, an opportunity that will significantly shape that person’s life outcomes.""

And Samson noted in his presentation here that these concerns are not just theoretical. In 2009, the University of California Board of Regents changed the admissions criteria for the system, generally eliminating the requirement of SAT subject tests. Advocates for Asian Americans noted at the time that this shift was taking away a criterion on which Asian-American applicants tended to do better, on average, than other groups."
virtu333,,"I occupy the same position in terms of outcomes - that asians shouldn't be discriminated against, that there is value in having diversity in terms of race, gender, socioeconomic status, geography, etc., and that there shouldn't be preferences for legacy and donor applicants.

We disagree on whether point 1 is occurring or not, but that's different in terms of the outcome preferences.

And I'm realistic about the framing of the opponents of affirmative action - they do not share your goal of eliminating as what you see is potential anti-asian bias, but supporting admissions practices that promote diversity, particularly in regards to race. They want it ""race-blind"" and affirmative action eliminated. Because as long as there is some preference for race for the sake of diversity, they interpret it as discrimination against asians. You don't, it seems, but that's the outcome they believe and are pushing for, and is the goal behind cases like this one."
sad_pizza,,"No where do you bring up the legality of discrimination in your comment. You made a blanket statement. So I made one in kind.

And while discrimination based on race in employment practices is illegal. Discrimination in this context is very difficult to prove and plaintiffs are very unlikely to win. Discrimination in employment practices are a lot more insidious because they are de facto legal."
InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"You're correct that it's illegal to explicitly consider race in employment, but it's a pretty gray area (in terms of knowing/proving whether race is being considered). So I'll revise myself to say that the second point (of your original comment) is not wrong, but it's also not the full story."
hank_scorpiooo,,"Affirmative action is not strictly proportional to the general population. Its sole design is to help bridge the gap between whites and under privileged minorities who may not be able to get as good as an education. 

For example, AP classes are harder to come by in inner city schools. So admissions can make a conscious decision to ignore the fact that a black student doesn't have any AP classes, and instead judge them based on how well they did with they had access to. Its much more nuanced then ""not enough x race, let 100 more in""."
lilsamuraijoe,,"What connection are you making between affirmative action and 'overindexing' and 'underindexing'? Affirmative action suggests that people who were discriminated against presently or in the past are treated favorably. Doesn't really speak much to what you are talking about. Its goal is not to make the student body more reflective of the nations actual demographics. If we want to incur a 5% increase in African American or Latino students in the student body with the express purpose affirmative action, why exactly should we care if the Caucasian demographic decreases 5% as a result? So as long as those who were discriminated against and those affected by white supremacy benefit, why should we care if Harvard's student body or incoming class was only 30-40% Caucasian, with increases in all minority groups? If you support an enrollment strategy that has a main goal of affirmative action, then I don't think you should. "

virtu333,,"There are explicit diversity initiatives at firms for recruiting that directly impact employment. E.g., top law firms have specific diversity internships for underrepresented minorities at these firms - which even Asian Americans are included in. This is on top of extra presentations, networking events, and affinity groups.

So I'd say you're more right than wrong, but it's a bit narrower - I don't think firms can explicitly use race/gender in general application pools, but they can allot certain programs for them."
virtu333,,"Gersen herself writes about how affirmative action is in serious trouble - and it's in trouble because of this case, its context and motivations, the judges, and how it will most likely be resolved. She doesn't delve into this much, just offers the usual waffling testimony of a SC nominee. Instead, she provides one interpretation of the case. But in law, there are many ways to interpret - which is why justices matter so much and why the SC nominee fights have been so bitter, and have been so impactful.

Let's assume that there truly is significant anti-Asian bias compared to other races. How does it get resolved? 

How would we like it resolved? The court tells Harvard that it can no longer discriminate against Asians, but only compared to whites. That's you and me right? Great, but it still doesn't get rid of preferences related to legacy and donors that vastly benefit whites and according to David Card's testimony, accounts for a significant amount of the difference between Asian American and white admit rates, unless the court can spin that in. Dubious that SC, especially such a conservative court, will do so.

But as long as affirmative action or race conscious admissions benefits underrepresented minorities, there will be those that argue it's discrimination against Asians (and by proxy, whites). And there's strong indication that this court would take this broader and conservative-favorable ruling of just getting rid of race conscious admissions, period. The former case would require much more legal gymnastics than this one, and it's unlikely Kavanaugh is going to go with that, which Gersen hints at.

If there were more Gersens and they were justices and they were on the court, then this interpretation would be much more relevant. It'd be key. But we have 5 very conservative justices on the court, so what matters more is how they'll look at it.

It'd be one thing if this were launching a strong campaign to dismantle the nepotism of favoring legacies and donors. But this won't even touch it - instead, the plain goals for everyone around is to dismantle affirmative action. And that's what matters."

tomatoeggsoysauc,,"To me, the argument about affirmative action is more than just about college admissions. By introducing personality scores into admissions, Harvard has introduced false racial stereotyping of Asian applicants into the problem. Yes it is true that there are underprivileged Asian kids living in ghettos or poor areas who are not scoring high on the SATs. Affirmative action is not good for them. I know because I have experience volunteering as a tutor in some of these areas.

But this issue is also harmful to the mental health of Asian kids growing up in middle class families in mostly white suburbs. So many of us say we need to talk more about mental health. Well, accuse me of over blowing it but this is part of what is harming some Asian kids’ mental health. We cannot accept white people falsely stereotyping Asian kids as these inhuman and robotic drones and making them hate themselves and each other. All of these things contribute to levels of internalized racism in different generations of Asian Americans.

It also colors the wider American perception of Asian Americans and excuses discrimination and crimes towards us. Americans will have less empathy towards people that they think have no personalities."

The ""personal"" scores for Asian applicants are only 10-20% lower than Black applicants if you take into account only alumni interviews.

SnooWoofers5193,,"I love Jay Caspian Kang and have 3 thoughts from my own observations. 

1. Asian people aren't as expressive. But are they not as personal? I've learned that Chinese sports and movies and shows tend to suck, and some of my mainland friends tell me the upbringing is harsh and asks you to learn processes and memorize facts rather than be weird and think outside the box. I wonder if it's *legitimate* that maybe we aren't as creative impressionable IN THE AMERICAN WAY. So when you're writing your college essay or doing an alumni interview, you might not be waxing poetry the same way another more culturally expressive kid might. Or, straight up, maybe your high school resume is plain. Is this true or stereotype?

OR

2. Asian people aren't as expressive but does that mean they don't have expressions? I love the word tsundere. One thing I've learned growing up is sometimes the big mouthed loud spoken friendly person often is fake as fk and the quiet person ends up contributing a lot to the friendship. It's not what you say, it's what you do. As I started meeting Asian people in college for the first time, I thought they were boring but asthe friendship matured I realized it was way more fulfilling than my other friendships, a slow burn. 

The problem is you can't do that in college apps. And a lot of east Asian kids know about saving face, being humble, and being patient, but that just doesn't fly. So what you write a bomb ass essay showing how good a person you are. For the kid who's love language and communication style isn't that expressive, r they rlly worse of an applicant?


My last thought is
 
3. Asian kids are in a confusing cultural divide in a world foreign to them and have a weak sense of identity that contributes to a lack of story in the college app. Following tiger parents leads to weak story and boilerplate app. You got a 1600, won robotics club, took 18 APs, 4.5GPA, played tennis, was in 4 academic clubs. What's your story? All my ivy league friends were able to articulate a clear narrative on who they were growing up and how they intend to live their life. National ping pong champ turned doctor, Carnegie hall piano player turned book writer, small town thrift shopper turned biologist. I'm almost afraid bc of internalized confusion, external harassment, and strong willed parents, Asian kids aren't giving themselves the space to find themselves young. Maybe the low personal score is for a reason or maybe it's all bullshit.

Admiral_Wen,,"This is my issue as well. Even as someone who believes in the importance of diversity, I think that ""personality"" score is a step backwards into racial stereotypes rather than something that facilitates diverse perspectives and backgrounds on campus. Especially since Harvard defines this personality score as ""[courage, integrity, and likeability](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/harvard-admissions-personality/563198/)"", which are completely subjective traits that are impossible to determine from a 30-second review of someone's college application. Not to mention, are we to just accept that the Harvard admission officers the ultimate authority on ""courage, integrity, and likeability""?

But as the article very clearly pointed out, the real issue is beyond admissions stats or some obscure score. The real issue is the artificial exclusivity imposed by these schools. They refuse to expand enrollments, despite the growing population and their swelling endowment accounts. Despite their undying vocal support for diversity, their classes are overwhelmingly the kids of wealthy families and past alumni year after year. (Great line from the article: *What do “diversity” and “equity” really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1 percent as from the bottom 20?*) Even when it comes to underrepresented racial minorities, rarely are those accepted from neighborhoods truly in need of uplifting.

Meanwhile, [43% of white kids are admitted on the basis of athletics, legacy, or parental donations, of which 75% wouldn't have qualified otherwise](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/study-harvard-finds-43-percent-white-students-are-legacy-athletes-n1060361)."
nuwio4,,"> The ""personal"" scores for Asian applicants are only 10-20% lower than Black applicants if you take into account only alumni interviews. But the discrepancy is over 200% when you look at the admissions office's scores.

Could you point to me where that's shown? Cause that does not at all track with my understanding of the alumni and admission office [personal ratings](https://imgur.com/IeJeUDw). Asians had, on average, the highest personal ratings from alumni interviewers. And the difference in the percentage of Blacks and Asians getting a high personal rating from admission officers was 1.04% (18.69% for Blacks, 17.65% for Asians)."
Colt459,,"Its easy to understand if you go through the legal papers (I'm a lawyer but they are very easy to read for anyone I think). It's actually not because Harvard exhibits an unconscious bias and thinks Asian Americans are stiff and lack personality (though I know that's how its made to sound in news articles). That may be (and probably is) true, but it's not the explanation for the personality ranks. Harvard ranks the personalities of *all* four major ""races"" exactly inversely proportional to each ""races"" cumulative academic strength. Blacks have (generally) the weakest academics, but the best personalities. Latinos the second weakest academics but second best personalities. Whites have the second strongest academics but second worst personalities.  Asians have the strongest academics but the worst personalities.

Ranking personalities this way gives Harvard much greater control over its racial composition than would be constitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. The truth is Harvard simply doesn't want too many Asians in its class each year. How many is too many? For Harvard, its more than about 20%. Every single year, Harvard would let in 19-20% Asians. In fact, all racial percentages were effectively static regardless of change in the country's demographics. So that's what the case has really been about. ""Personality"" is just the opaque device Harvard is using to keep Asian American numbers down and other racial numbers, especially Black numbers up (whites and Latinos are mostly in the middle of all of this). Data suggests Harvard's class would be about 43% Asian if it removed affirmative action's racial considerations.

Why do this?  The reason  is actually not because Harvard hates Asians. That's a false narrative that you hear ***both*** pro-affirmative action and anti-affirmative action people argue. It's because Harvard, like all colleges, has a maximum number of seats each year. Asians, followed closely by whites, are the two groups that have the strongest qualifications. If Harvard Administrators were never told the race of the applicants, Asians and whites would comprise over 80% of its student population. Because black  (followed by Latino) applicants generally have lower grades and test scores than whites and Asians, those two groups would shrink the most to make room for an increase of the Asian class from 20% to 40%. (It should obviously go without saying there are black and Latino applicants with perfect scores). Harvard could reject more white applicants but, again, to do so solely because of those applicants' skin color would invite another obvious equal protection challenge--and rightfully so.

Legacy admits are the main population served by these old new england institutions. They're the target demographic, all that money has been donated to serve. Most students barely pay any tuition. Legacy admitts pay for everyone's education via donations, and full price tuition.

More importantly ""but the system is rigged for rich white people too, let's get rid of that"" is just a whataboutism.

There is no justification for racial descrimination in admissions."

,,"It’s Time for an Honest Conversation About Affirmative Action  
Jan. 27, 2022  
By Jay Caspian Kang  
  
Opinion Writer  
  
On Monday, the Supreme Court announced it would hear arguments in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. In 2014, the group sued the university, accusing it of discriminating against Asian students during its admissions process. After years of court filings and an actual trial, S.F.F.A. ultimately lost its case but immediately appealed to the Supreme Court.  
  
I spent much of 2018 and 2019 covering that trial and getting to know its main players. Edward Blum, the conservative legal activist pushing the lawsuit, was behind Fisher v. University of Texas, the last college admissions affirmative action case to reach the Supreme Court. In the 2010s, he also spearheaded Shelby County v. Holder, which effectively gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He is a tireless activist who will now have his hearing in front of a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. If the justices find in S.F.F.A.’s favor, Blum will have had a hand in both disenfranchising thousands of voters and ending affirmative action as we know it.  
  
This work has turned Blum into a villain in progressive circles, and some have denounced the whole package as a right-wing program to end racial preferences and remediations in every corner of American life. I generally agree with this assessment and fear the world Blum might bring about.  
  
But it’s also important to assess the specifics of the Harvard case. When excised from the context of Blum’s crusade, they reveal a profoundly broken system that relies on obfuscation and misdirection, especially when it comes to the treatment of Asian applicants.  
  
Did Harvard discriminate against Asian students?  
  
This is a question with a both complicated and simple answer. On the one hand, proving that Harvard violated the legal standards set by earlier Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action is difficult, given both the amorphous nature of the admissions process and the intricacy and various contradictions in the law. As it stands now, colleges are allowed to consider the race of an applicant, but only to a limited extent and not in a way that resembles a quota system.  
  
But when you apply the normative definition of discrimination, in which race hinders an applicant’s acceptance into an institution, the case becomes much clearer. The evidence against Harvard on that front is, frankly, overwhelming. Asian applicants to Harvard routinely scored significantly lower than students of other races on their “personal scores,” a metric cobbled together from alumni interviews, essays and teacher recommendations. During the trial, Harvard’s attorneys did not really explain why this disparity existed, but only tried to prove that it did not come out of intentional or even implicit bias from anyone inside the admissions office. What seemed to be happening was that the people writing the appraisals were routinely downgrading Asian students, judgments that Harvard apparently accepted without any further investigation.  
  
I don’t really know why Asians got low personal scores, but I do know that if Harvard drapes itself in the mantle of diversity, inclusion and equity, it should probably also take a look at the way it uses evaluations that seem to reflect bias. Harvard continues to use recommendations today.  
  
One of the clearest examples of Harvard’s history of anti-Asian discrimination that was presented at the trial centered around “sparse country,” a term Harvard uses to describe geographic regions that generally do not send a lot of students to the Ivy League. Sparse country students generally get a bump in the admissions process because the university seeks to have a student body that’s geographically as well as racially diverse.  
  
In the past, Harvard recruited students from sparse country after they took the Preliminary SAT exams. To receive an invitation to apply to Harvard — yes, some students receive invitations to apply to Harvard — a Black student in sparse country needed to score above 1100 on the exams, a white student needed 1310, an Asian female student needed 1350 and an Asian male student needed 1380.  
  
This, by itself, seems like enough to prove that Harvard created a system for recruitment that certainly preferences one race over the other. The testimony given by William Fitzsimmons, the longtime dean of Harvard admissions, only made his office look worse. When asked to explain why Asian students from sparse country needed to score so much higher than white students, Fitzsimmons said, “There are people who, let’s say, for example, have only lived in the sparse-country state for a year or two.”  
  
What he seems to be saying is that Harvard believes Asian students from sparse country are Asian before they are Arkansan or Nevadan or Alaskan and that whatever diversity benefit they might bring to the school will be based on their ethnicity, not from the state where they may have spent their whole lives. To Fitzsimmons, evidently, and by extension, the Harvard admissions office, Asian applicants are not citizens with legitimate ties to a community but are instead newcomers who should be thought of by their race.  
  
Evidence of this type of reductive racial thinking could be found throughout the trial. Past documents brought to light showed that Harvard would consider your “ethnicity” a “plus” only if you wrote your personal essay about its significance in your life or if it led to extracurricular involvement in ethnic community groups. If you were a minority student who did not belong to an affinity group in high school and you did not share a moment of trauma or triumph with strangers on the admissions committee for the most prestigious university in the world, Harvard would withhold the “plus” on your application.  
  
Does anyone really believe in a version of “equity” and “diversity” that forces minority students to, in essence, perform their ethnicity for Harvard, of all places?  
  
So, if all this is done in the name of diversity, what exactly does it look like at places like Harvard?  
  
I am an alumni of Bowdoin College, which at the time I attended, in the late ’90s and early 2000s, had a very small percentage of Black, Latino and Asian students. The school has changed quite a bit since then, thanks to strong diversity initiatives. On the occasions I’ve returned to campus, I’ve come across students of all sorts of ethnic backgrounds who simply would not have been at Bowdoin in my era. This more inclusive atmosphere made me feel excited to be on campus, even as an adult, and undoubtedly would have improved my undergraduate experience. When you read the case law of affirmative action cases or diversity statements from exclusive colleges, they largely speak of the need to make all students feel comfortable and represented on campus. I do not dispute the importance of this."

Because they have the second strongest academic qualifications. Its very important for anyone discussing this case to understand the allegation of why the personality scores are assigned the way they are. Its about racial quotas, not actual personality. Period.

I agree with your second point (although the author doesn't actually show whether socioeconomic makeup changed or not, but that's a nitpick). That lack of socioeconomic diversity also extends [more broadly](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/rvaez7/who_actually_gets_to_create_black_pop_culture/). Or consider government leaders appointing cabinets, committee/department heads, etc. I hear about gender and racial/ethnic diversity, but I get the impression that socioeconomic diversity is rarely talked about. If you're in a government position that's related to dealing with poverty, homelessness, labor, etc. Would it not be useful to have people who's life experiences have proximity to those issues?"
,,[removed]
EliteNemesis,Viet in the Bay,"Yeah, so the ""average"" in the table you link to is kinda poorly labeled.  It's actually a weighted average, with this [chart](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-769bc83b7206a14917ea05af095abfda-pjlq) providing the raw numbers for the applicants.

For example, there are 6,140 Asian American applicants who are in the top academic decile (the 10th decile is the highest, the 1st decile is the lowest) versus, for example, 91 African Americans.  And in the bottom decile, there are 5,550 African Americans versus 1,440 Asian Americans.

The reason why the (weighted) ""average"" shows Asian Americans having a higher average is because the median Asian American applicant is in the 7th or 8th decile.  In contrast, the median African American applicant is in the 2nd decile.

Despite the pretty marked difference in the academic quality of the applicant pool, a higher percentage of African American applicants nevertheless get a high personal score than Asian American applicants from the admissions office.  Of course, it may be the case that the average African American applicant has perhaps a more compelling life story due to a challenging upbringing, poverty, etc.  And you are right that the average Asian American applicant (who is the 7th or 8th decile) is more likely to get a high personal score than the average African American applicant (who is in the 2nd decile) from alumni.

But if you compare the raw percentages at each decile, which this [graph](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e2d876fe82eb504a4d97add6ccf2a40d-pjlq) does, the discrepancy I noted above becomes obvious, and is staggering at the higher deciles.

For example, at the bottom decile, 9.49% of the 5,550 African American applicants get a high personal score from the admissions office, versus 8.01% of the 1,440 Asian American applicants.  Not a huge surprise, since these are the applicants who performed the worse academically.  But note that there is still almost a 20% difference in favor of African American students (9.49/8.01=1.18).  Likewise, 30.96% of the same pool of bottom decile African American applicants get a high score from the alumni, versus 28.13% of the Asian American applicants.  The discrepancy narrows to about 10% (30.96/28.13=1.10), though it's pretty obvious that alumni reviewers are much more generous with high personal scores than the admissions office.

But if you go to the 5th decile, the difference is staggering.  33.89% of African American applicants are given a high personal store by the admissions office, versus 15.69% for Asian American students.  That 18 point gap is a 116% difference.

On the alumni side for applicants at 5th decile, 59.98% of African American applicants got a high personal score from alumni, versus 44.24% of Asian American applicants.  Still a pretty large 15 point gap, but here the African American applicant is only 35% more likely to get a high personal score.

Hope that helps."
Intact,,"Great post. A few nits:

> Asians, followed closely by whites, are the two groups that have the strongest qualifications.

Do white students really have the strongest qualifications? I don't think that necessarily tracks just from the finding that Asians and whites would make up 80%+ of the student population in a race-blind admissions system.

[This study linked elsewhere in the thread](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/study-harvard-finds-43-percent-white-students-are-legacy-athletes-n1060361) states that 43% of white students at Harvard are ""legacy, athletes, [or] related to donors or staff,"" 75 percent of whom would have been rejected if they had not come from those categories.

I think athletics are fine qualifications, but legacy, donor-relation, or staff-relation status ring hollow as qualifications, and I think that to assert that white students would actually have such strong qualifications, you'd want a statistic talking about class makeup with these categories stripped out, and/or discussing qualifications of rejected white applicants relative to other races.

> Harvard could reject more white applicants but, again, to do so solely because of those applicants' skin color would invite another obvious equal protection challenge--and rightfully so.

Agreed. The sentence composition suggests that reducing white student class share would risk violating EQP, but I think it's worth clarifying that there are non-race-related methods that I think ultimately (post-litigation) wouldn't violate EQP. Going after legacy, donor, and staff-related admits are all methods I think that could balance out white seat share with appropriate legal cover. That said, will Harvard ever do this? Probably not.

I think this is honestly the segment that everyone should be going after. I don't just mean asians, either. There are probably a number of highly qualified white applicants who would also be getting in each year if a high percentage of the class were not getting in off their parents' laurels. This group makes up 15% of the Harvard class overall, which I think is pretty ridiculous: that equals the entire black seat share at Harvard, engulfs the latinx seat share, and is 60% of the Asian seat share."
,,">Harvard ranks the personalities of *all* four major ""races"" exactly inversely proportional to each ""races"" cumulative academic strength. Blacks have (generally) the weakest academics, but the best personalities. Latinos the second weakest academics but second best personalities. Whites have the second strongest academics but second worst personalities. Asians have the strongest academics but the worst personalities.

> Data suggests Harvard's class would be about 43% Asian if it removed affirmative action's racial considerations.

> If Harvard Administrators were never told the race of the applicants, Asians and whites would comprise over 80% of its student population.

Don't those two statements kind of contradict each other? I'm aware that Harvard's preliminary internal review showed that if they only considered academic achievement, percentage of Asian students would rise from 19% to 43%. But I don't know what that second stat is referring to."
owlficus,,"So instead of an *unconscious* bias in rating asians stiff, Harvard employs a *conscious* bias to rate asians stiff.  

I understand that the  idea of class being comprised of 43% of asians (or any race) feels “not right” to many ppl- but meritocracy must be held sacred. Shoehorning a solution to tweak the demographics at the university level is not the right thing to do- even if it is the quickest way to get that university’s diversity nbrs up (whether that’s an altruistic goal for the uni or a self serving one is another discussion). The right thing to do, is to  apply affirmative action at the high school or even junior high level in the form of social/academic  outreach  (eg free prep classes) to black/hispanic kids to even the playing field - ie, empower them to realize their highest scores. To unlock their potential that their disadvantages have suppressed. Scores held equal, black/hispanic kids should then be given priority seats- as opposed to artificially bumping up some aggregate metric and using this to give priority.  

The right goal should not be to let more black and hispanics into Harvard, the right goal should be to let more black and hispanics who have the talent into Harvard.  As an analogy: Say you wanted to diversify your basketball team, but still wanted to develop the best players. You wouldn’t recruit someone who shoots the ball pretty close to the basket, but can’t actually make the shot. Instead maybe you would fund early training  programs to bring out the talent. 

Affirmative action as it’s employed now, is tweaking with quotas purely based on race at the expense of qualifications, which is discriminatory, ironically.

nuwio4,,"It's not whataboutism. At Harvard, athletes, children of alumni, children of Harvard faculty/staff, and children of donors make up 5% of the applicant pool, but 29% of accepted students. That's a lot of data to overlook if we want to talk seriously about discrimination and fairness."
Essteethree,,"Curious as to why you think legacies should play any role in determining your eligibility. Studies have shown that affluent (in general) perform better in school, and have higher test scores. If your parent went to Harvard, you likely grew up with all the opportunities in the world. The way I see it, accepting legacy candidates who aren't eligible under their own accomplishments only serves to keep the rich rich, and uphold institutional racism."
,,">I'm personally in favor of massively taxing private school endowments (aka hedge funds hiding behind non-profit status) as long as they are not socioeconomically diverse, and routing those taxes to public universities. There's no reason why the USA cannot be like Canada where the top universities are public. Internationally, many top universities (ETH Zurich) are public!

I wonder why American universities dominate the top 20, and why the class sizes are so small, and why they're basically 4-star resorts with all the amenities.

I also wonder what you seem to gain by taxing an entity's long term financial stability. As a private or not private entity, in the long term a school will have way more money to spend on students, faculty, and facilities if it takes donations, invests them, and draws from them at a sustainable rate.

Princeton's endowment for example, subsidizes each student to by over 60k per head."
,,"But while the percentage of “students of color” at Bowdoin has gone up to 35.1 percent in 2021 from an abysmal 7.5 percent in 1988, there has been little meaningful change in socio-economic backgrounds. Twenty percent of Bowdoin students come from families who make $630,000 or more a year. Sixty-nine percent come from families in the top 20 percent of income earners in the country. Only 3.8 percent come from the bottom 20 percent. Increased racial diversity has not changed the fact that exclusive schools cater almost entirely to a wealthy population.  
  
Bowdoin is far from being an outlier. A full 15 percent of Harvard students come from families who make $630,000 or more a year, and only 4.5 percent from the bottom fifth of income earners. Elite state institutions aren’t much better. Two-thirds of students at the University of Virginia, for example, hail from the top fifth; only 2.8 percent come from the bottom 20 percent.  
  
What do “diversity” and “equity” really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1 percent as from the bottom 20?  
  
The browning of these elite institutions should be seen as progress on its own, and it would be harmful if these trends were suddenly reversed. But to what extent is all this just window dressing? Elite schools in liberal cities, whether they are private elementary schools or the Ivy League schools, do not populate their websites with all kinds of faces out of some heartfelt desire to contribute to an equitable society. Rather, they push diversity because they know their customers — the students and their parents — want it. Plus, they couldn’t get away with being majority white or even white and Asian without attracting a great deal of scrutiny.  
  
The impending Supreme Court decision will change none of this. Schools like Harvard that can fill their incoming freshman class many times over with top-tier applicants of every race are likely to maintain their diversity levels, more or less.  
  
Over the past two decades, there’s also been a quiet but fierce argument over who, exactly, constitutes the Black and Latino student populations at elite colleges. At a Harvard Black alumni gathering in 2004, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the late Lani Guinier, professors at the school, noted that perhaps as many as two-thirds of Harvard’s Black students were first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean or the children of biracial couples.  
  
This is an extremely fraught conversation to have because it asks a person to rank Black people in terms of oppression and could encourage schools to enact an even more specific and potentially xenophobic set of hierarchies. Black immigrants appear to be overrepresented at elite colleges when compared with African Americans who have descended from slavery. This, of course, is not the fault of Black immigrants who attend these schools, but rather the schools themselves, who have turned college admissions into a brutal, zero-sum game in which each minority applicant must also double as a racial statistic.  
  
“I just want people to be honest enough to talk about it,” Gates said in 2004. “What are the implications of this?”  
  
For me, the implications are as follows: At elite schools, affirmative action mostly serves an increasingly ethnically varied group of wealthy students and their families. As a result, the narrative around diversity in these places has been reduced to pure racial representation, which, while important enough, does not exactly fulfill the social mission that most people think is inherent to any affirmative action program — helping students whose families have suffered under generations of white supremacy. Anti-Asian discrimination, which I believe to be as clear as day, is one of the byproducts of all this balancing and weighting and obfuscation.  
  
Schools like Harvard have no one to blame but themselves. Their flimsy approach to “diversity” and their desire to stay as academically exclusive as possible have created an indefensible system of racial nonsense that demeans not only its Asian and Black applicants, but everyone else who has to play this absurd game.  
  
This, I believe, would be the honest starting point for conversations about affirmative action at elite schools.  
  
On Monday, I will write about what an alternative might look like.

tomatoeggsoysauc,,The focus on Asian kids’ personalities can also be harmful to their self-esteem.

Colt459,,"See my comment above yours. If you read the legal papers you will see that the point is the personality scores for all the four ""races""--not just Asian Americans--are pure fiction. The ratings are exactly, and intentionally, inversely proportional to academic strength. They exist to allow Harvard to tweak its racial makeup and keep Asian admissions down to 20% (from near 40%) so that it can keep the percentages of other, more desirable ethnicities up. The discrimination in this case is about misusing a seemingly ""neutral""  personality rating to effect specific racial quotas. There is no a sincere belief that Asians have worse personalities. Just like Harvard doesn't really think white people have the second worse personalities or that black people have the best personalities. Its all a fiction to keep Asians students at exactly 19-21% enrollment and other ethnicities at the proportions Harvard wants."

> For the personal rating, Card includes the following variables: intended career; staff interview ratings; richer controls for high school and neighborhood characteristics; parents’ occupations; applicant’s hours worked (at a job); controls for specific combinations of profile ratings, specific combinations of teacher ratings, and specific combinations of alumni interview ratings; indicators for participation in different types of primary extracurricular activities; having parents who attended an Ivy League college, having parents who attended Harvard for graduate school, having a mother or father who is deceased, being a permanent resident of the United States, having been born in the United States, and having lived outside the US.

Expanding on what you briefly mentioned, if - due to differing immigration pressures, past discrimination, self-selection, prestige-drive, etc. - Asian applicants, on average, differ in those variables above, that might explain what are, from what I understand, [""very slightly weaker""](https://medium.com/@dddefenddiversitydd/anti-asian-american-bias-exists-but-here-are-ten-reasons-not-to-fall-for-the-asian-american-71ef01195189) personal ratings on average.

Is there data on the racial breakdown of medium to low personal ratings that would affect interpretations? I don't expect it would, but I'm still curious if it might."
Colt459,,"Yes, whites have the second strongest *academic* qualifications after Asians and have the second hardest time getting into Harvard based on those qualifications. The admittance rate for Asians in the top decile of applicants is 12.7%. The admittance rate for whites in the top decile is 15.3%. That means its more likely for a white person to get in with the same academic grades. But then when you get to Latinos, the admittance rate in the top decile is a whopping 31.1%. And then the admittance rate in the top decile for black applicants its 56.1%. These are giant differences. If you follow the table all the way down in turns out that you can be in the fourth lowest decile in academics as a black applicant and you still have a better chance of admission (12.8%) than an Asian applicant in the top decile.

I find the white legacy article interesting, but too vague to be very compelling. First, the study your referencing doesn't do any comparisons between the four race groups . Lumping athletics in with legacy complicates things. What percentage of African Americans  get in from athletic scholarship vs Latinos? vs whites?  vs Asians?  Without breaking this down and giving comparisons its an interesting stat, but it has the possibility at least to be misleading.

Second, because Harvard is obviously capping the admissions rate for the four races year in and year out, its possible unqualified white legacy's are eating into the admission share of *other* more qualified white applicants.  Harvard wants the same number of Asians,, whites, Latinos, and blacks every year. So 51% of Harvard's class is white (and I argued this once with someone who said that means whites are actually underrepresented in Harvard since they are more than 51% of the general population in the U.S. and I laughed because that's technically true). That number stays pretty constant according to Harvard's data. But the article doesn't explain unless I missed it if the preference for white legacy's is actually hurting minorities or if its really just eating into Harvard's ""white seats."" Given the other data about the academic strength of whites and Asians, I suspect it doesn't hurt Latino and Black applicants as much as you might think. But this is just speculation without more detail in the article.

In any event, Legacy admissions need to go too. They aren't unconstitutional but they are anti-merit. I'm cool with donor admissions and athletics though."

wyzra,,">The SFFA documents also provide insight into how admissions officers score the personal component of an applicant's rating. The documents assert readers first arrive at a student’s personal score by “examining a variety of ‘subjective’ factors,” including applicants’ “character traits” and whether they have a “positive personality.”  
Harvard’s filing states that admissions officers review candidates’ “humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness and many other qualities” when determining the personal rating.

> Harvard uses a search list, which is primarily compiled based on potential applicants' ACT, SAT or PSAT test scores to help Harvard market itself to a diverse array of high school students. The ACT, SAT, or PSAT score that students need to make the search list varies by gender, high school GPA, geography, and race. For example, to make Harvard's class of 2018 search list, a white male high school student from outside ""sparse country"" needed an SAT score of 1380, while black, Chicano, Hispanic, Native American, and Puerto Rican students needed only an 1100.

> As SFFA points out, there are some anomalies in the search list selection criteria that are difficult to explain. As an example, assuming an applicant reported a sufficiently high GPA, for the class of 2018, Harvard lowered the SAT score required to make the search list to 1310 for students from “sparse country” who identified their race as white, other, or unidentified while not simultaneously lowering the required score for Asian American students from the same states to the same level. Consequently, Asian American students from the same states needed to score 1350 or 1380, depending on their gender, to make the search list. Some Asian American students therefore did not make the search list, when white students from the same area who had similar grades and SAT scores did. SFFA, while recognizing that the list is a marketing tool, would have the Court consider this “sparse country” disparity between the scores required for Asian Americans and whites to make the search list as evidence of Harvard's intent to impose more selective admissions criteria on Asian Americans for the purpose of artificially suppressing Asian American representation at Harvard.

> Notably, however, in some of the same years that Harvard did not lower the sparse country SAT search list score for Asian Americans commensurate with the lower requirement for whites, it selected Asian Americans for the search list based on lower ACT scores than similarly situated white students from more urban states. Overall, the inconsistencies in the search criteria do not seem to be linked to efforts to advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group, and it was unclear from the testimony at trial whether these variations were accidental or intentional. At root, although being placed on the search list results in recruitment and is correlated with a higher likelihood of admission, the search list is fundamentally a marketing tool that does not affect individual admissions decisions."
Colt459,,"Huh? You think its *just* white people? It's everyone. The irony is its not even that stereotype that's causing Asians to be discriminated against at Harvard.   We know from the set-in-stone  racial percentages that Harvard's real concern was always about getting the precise percentage of Asians, whites, Latinos, and blacks, that it wanted. No more, no less. The personality point is a red herring. No matter how many qualified Asian applicants with 10/10 personalities applied,  Harvard was giving them bad personality scores because letting them in would mean less seats for their other race categories.

This is why the Affirmative Action system, while noble and originally helpful, has become utterly unworkable as America has become more diverse and racial lines have started to blur. It's become a slimy business which places way too much emphasis on race. An Asian applicant in the TOP decile (top 10%) of academic performance has a worse chance at getting into Harvard than a black applicant in bottom 40% of academic performance. That's not simply selecting an underrepresented minority all other things being equal. That's an entirely different selection standard. If you're OK with that, great. But that's like being OK with being forced to sit in the back of the bus. You may think its not big deal, but I find it outrageous.

Legacy admissions should go as a matter of objectivity as well even though they are not unconstitutional (and even though they are now, finally starting to help minorities).

I am, however, a realist about donor admissions. Donors help fund the school for everyone's benefit. So along with athletics, I wouldn't touch that."

Yep! This is why I said, ""I don't just mean asians, either.

> Some of those who contend that affirmative action is what kept them out of medical school argue that some low-scoring black applicants are in the med school seats they should have gotten. I did the math to see how likely that is.

> Figure 4 shows that it’s far more likely a white applicant “stole a spot” than a black applicant. For a white applicant with a 31 MCAT score and a 3.7 GPA, for every black applicant who scored lower and was accepted there are, on average, 4.11 white students who also scored lower and were accepted.

> It’s only low-scoring white applicants (less than a 26 on the MCAT and a GPA less than 3.2) who are more likely to have “their” seats offered to black students than to white students. Yet at that end of the statistical spectrum, the chance of getting into medical school is less than 5 percent for both whites and blacks. But look at the average number of low-scoring black students accepted each year (132) and the total number of white applicants accepted each year (26,420). The chance that a low-scoring white medical school applicant will “lose” a spot to a low-scoring black applicant is 0.5 percent. How unlikely is that?

> Keep in mind that some schools admit a far larger number of students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in medicine (URM) than others, whether that’s due to various race-based initiatives (e.g., historically black college or university; diversity initiatives), geography (i.e., certain states have relatively few individuals from URM backgrounds and prefer in-state students), or some other reason. 

> There is one other major source of complication. It’s well documented that race is strongly associated with socioeconomic status (i.e., educational attainment, income) and academic opportunity in the United States. Specifically, individuals from URM backgrounds tend to also have lower socioeconomic status and fewer academic opportunities.

> Unfortunately, we’re also unaware of any data demonstrating the percentage of students accepted to medical schools by race, over and above socioeconomic status.

I am a first generation Chinese-american student from a low-income family. My parents rent a mom and pop shop and makes just enough to scrape by. However, over 30% of my school are also low income, many are immigrants like me (i also worked after school to help with the family business but I didn't mention it because I remember our counselor specifically telling us to avoid mentioning our experiences as first generation/low-income immigrants because there are too many of us as chinese-americans and universities no longer care.). Over 40% of the school population were Chinese American, and over 60% were Asian American. My grades were high (over 4.0 GPA) compared to the national average but average compared to other Chinese kids at my school. Chinese-american students are considered overrepresented in universities in my state, especially from my school. My school is well-funded and has many opportunities for extracurriculars and APs, but I would be taking 2-4 APs while my classmates took 5-7.

My description seems to fit the bill in some areas, but it also seems to detract in some areas? How do I compare?"

also, in my semi-researched opinion, the real solution is better education access in poor neighbourhoods, especially at the elementary level. trying to correct it at the post secondary level will always be morally questionable, especially if you’re considering race when you really should be considering economic bracket (which correlated with race which is fine, but takes care of outliers that will fall through when considering race, like wealthy underrepresented groups who benefitted similarly as other wealthy over represented groups, or poor overrepresented groups who worked harder than their other underrepresented counterparts)."

To me, intersectional means: disaggregate by ethnicity (for everyone), look at parent's education (they already do), elementary school zip code, ever being low-income, English as a non-first language. I'm sure there are others the experts will remember to include. Hopefully, they have a free-form box like the NIH where people can opt-in to discuss difficulties.

I just hope it's not half-assed like a lot of private universities, where most of the students still come from the top 1% regardless of race/ethnicity. Attending one of those as a scholarship student, people just assumed that I was like my roommate (also E Asian American) with a professor parent, stay-at-home mother, time to do extracurriculars, took the SATs several times and a prep class. She didn't understand why I spent so much time working and wanted all the newest tech. As far as I could tell, the super-rich (went on Spring break to the Carribeans; winter break to ski in Europe) and the rich self-stratified through the Greek system ($>1000/semester) and other philanthropy clubs that expected donations. Then it was a bunch of scholarship students hanging out together, stressed about time studying vs working and getting a job afterwards.

University education is really important in my field. Going to a good university was extremely helpful. I'd hope a more diverse group (ethnically, economically) of people could benefit from the same advantages. Many of my classmates found internships and jobs afterwards through family connections (including people with not-so-good grades). I'm sure their $$$ is great for scholarship funding, but at the same time, those people didn't really need a fancy education, especially if they didn't take advantage of it."

It won't establish a quota system as quota was already declared unconstitutional in 1978 by SCOTUS. Proponents of ACA 5 also advocate for data disaggregation which will help SEA, and many SEA groups also support affirmative action. 

In the long run ACA5 is just one of the many but necessary reforms. Divestment in higher education is what has been hurting Asian American student enrollment at the UCs the most, not affirmative action. The state of California is not keeping up with its promises in the Master Plan for Higher Education by providing enough higher education opportunities for qualified CA high school grads. Admission rate for Asian American students to UCs has been declining even though affirmative action has been banned since 1996 because investment in higher education system is not keeping up with the population demand despite the state’s immense wealth. Instead of blaming it on other groups and making it a zero sum game, why don't we fight for better opportunities for everyone and hold the government accountable?

CrazyRichBayesians,,"I've come around on affirmative action, mostly because my earlier views were built on assumptions that I don't really believe anymore.

**Admission into a prestigious university isn't a prize to be won by pre-university performance.** The way I see it now, prestigious universities have a responsibility to their communities to identify and equip those who will likely be leaders in the future, in part through education of their students, in part through giving students the opportunity to network with others of different backgrounds (and who will go on to pursue different paths), and in part by identifying applicants with that future potential. After all, 18 year olds are pretty much universally unimpressive - it's just that there are indicators of which ones have potential to be impressive adults in their 20's, 30's, 40's, and even 50's and beyond.

Seen through that light, university admissions should strive to admit a diverse incoming class, including socioeconomic, geographical, cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity, as well as diversity in intellectual interests and even age. Otherwise, if the students all come from a homogenous background, they will likely go back to that homogenous background and are less likely, as a cohort, to make impacts on broad swaths of society. So a prestigious university should want to admit students who have a chance at succeeding in their own areas across society, rather than lining up students who will all try to succeed by pursuing the same path after graduation. In the same way that a basketball team would want a more sophisticated recruiting procedure than ""let's just sign the tallest 12 players we can,"" a university should understand that they're recruiting for multiple positions, multiple roles.

Plus, a prestigious degree might be more valuable of a ticket to someone poor than someone who is already rich. In a sense, thinking about how to distribute a limited resource (fancy degree) towards the most productive use will favor distributing towards those for whom that degree provides the greatest delta over a replacement degree (less fancy degree). For someone who is poor, for whom the elite universities have generous financial aid packages, that delta might be huge if they fall back into getting admitted into a less affordable option, and have to dig out from a greater amount of student debt.

**Past experience with hardship can often reveal likelihood of future success better than raw academic scores.** Someone with 90th percentile test scores is much more impressive when they come from a poor background, and have parents who don't have college degrees, than someone with similar scores from a rich private school with well-connected parents. Those with privilege tend to overperform their ""true"" ability on things like standardized tests, while those with hardship tend to underperform their true ability. 

And like it or not, race itself carries privileges or burdens, so any race-blind method of measuring hardship or tenacity will necessarily miss some of the nuances. Hardship should be a significant factor in university admissions, and race is a significant factor in hardship.

**Intelligence, academic performance, and academic foundations have diminishing returns at the top.** There's no guarantee that the kid with a 1550 SAT will outperform the kid with the 1500 SAT once college starts. Or 10 years after college, when they're in the workforce. At a certain point, students simply exceed the threshold of what one needs to have in order to succeed at university, so that even higher scores are no longer all that predictive of future success.

With that in mind, the university admissions committees are going to be looking at a lot more qualified students than there are spots, so that dividing that group of qualified students might be better served by considering other criteria other than those that got them into the qualified category in the first place. In other words, it might be best to admit the qualified students with the most interesting back stories, who are most likely to contribute something new to the class, who have overcome the most significant hardships, rather than just subdividing the already qualified group into ""most qualified"" and ""less qualified."" So ""academic merit"" should be seen as a gate that all applicants must pass through, but once on the other side, the criteria can and should change to completely other things.

Besides, purely ranking based on ""merit"" gets strained when talking about where alumni/donors, athletes, the ""z list"" (where applicants are asked to reapply after taking a gap year), nontraditional students, and international students fit into the mix. Admission isn't just about merit (and merit is such a fuzzy concept), so any discussion of affirmative action needs to move away from the false dichotomy of merit versus diversity."

The UCs offered this glimmer of hope that we could compete under equal footing and not have an already rigged game rigged against us even further. 

Same goes with the SATs. Sure, the odds were stacked against us from the start, but unlike internships, research opportunities, and pricey niche extracurriculars, there is actually some hope that you can work your ass off in Khan Academy and score high to prove yourself, while the latter is all but inaccessible to lower income students w/o connections.

Your links still haven't explained how there's actual research showing that Asian Americans will be more easily admitted in university thanks to AA. Or that there are actual moves by universities to apply AA in such a way that it doesn't decrease the chances for Asian applicants.

If they want to make more chances so that other minority groups can be accepted, that's great. But then take it away from white people, why the need to take it away from Asian applicants? Why not take it away from legacy applicants? Unless they make it clear and apparent that it won't decrease the chances for Asian applicants, this isn't really helping against white supremacy, just a way to make it more palatable to the masses."

netting-the-netter,,"Typically, it’s about diversity. If they were just to look at income levels then a lot of campuses would still be too Asian seeing as there are a lot of poor Asians in this country. It’s just easy to not notice them, or just ignore them, because there are also a lot of Asians that are doing really well. It’s because of this that those elite public high schools in NYC wanted to do away with placement testing. If they kept the test but took income level into account then then it wouldn’t have changed the student population much because a huge chunk of the Asian kids lived at and below the poverty line."
,,"I think it depends on the specific policy so it’s good to define options. The U Michigan version that went to the Supreme Court added points for being an URM. The Texas Top 10% doesn’t explicitly involve race and instead depends on the racial and economic segregation of the public high school system. One of the proposed selective high school reforms in NYC also used the top of each high school. Comparing the different districts that funneled into my high school, the difference in preparation was huge and accounted for a lot of differences in our first year grades. A lot of that was kept when we were tracked into honors/regular/remedial in HS.

Gary Gutting wrote an opinion in the NYTimes that argued for producing black professionals (excluding African immigrants). Beyond equity, it would also change norms. I would also add that it changes outcomes for society. In medicine, I think it’s definitely worthwhile and helps improve patient outcomes. While some may argue about lower quality, there are licensing steps to ensure that and some programs to make sure students meet those requirements (eg extra time in medical school, tutoring, etc) without dropping out. I think society needs more black doctors to help address the health disparity and affirmative action can help. 

There are also more and more support services like Questbridge that provide exam prep, admissions coaching, or help after admissions to stay in college. These aren’t formally considered affirmative action. It’s become necessary because of the private services (I was recruited to help for grad school...let’s just say it paid more per hour than grad school does.) 

Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing a forced integration system because I think it’s on the right track to make parents upset that their precious kid might sit next to someone from the next district over or be bused over there. It might make them actually care that a school doesn’t have enough books for each student or enough staff to field a gifted program. Or a school nurse. I lived near a shifting boundary and the difference was tremendous. (And neither was one of the good high schools.)"
NoIdentify,,"This argument for affirmative action falls apart once you realize that race isn't the only metric, or even a particularly useful metric for diversity that we as a society should use.

I agree with everything you said about solely academic metrics being inadequate for satisfying the needs for society - people are more than just SAT scores or GPAs. However, our current application process already provides a lot of room for showing hardship. People in low socioeconomic status brackets can already write about the problems they faced growing up poor or having to work to provide for their family, or can choose to write about their experiences with police brutality, microaggressions, or racism if they feel like it was a fundamental part of their upbringing. Colleges already have a ""leadership"" and ""potential"" metric they optimize for - it just so happens that Asian people do well on them due to a cultural emphasis on education and hard work, and therefore are overrepresented in admissions.

When you say that racial diversity is a goal we should strive for, do you mean that all colleges should have a student body with exactly the same racial demographics as the United States? Does that mean all colleges should have a maximum of 3% of their student body as Asian, despite the fact that Asian culture places a much higher emphasis on education than American culture?

Asians are already discriminated against in other walks of life, through no fault of our own. Nobody demands that all movies have a 3% asian cast, the NBA or NFL has 3% Asian players, or 3% of US politicians are Asian. All of a sudden when it comes to education, the one aspect of society that Asians are overrepresented in due to our culture's emphasis on it, people demand that we start using race as a qualifying metric.

The debate on whether race as a standalone quality should be used to judge people is already largely settled in the United States. If you asked people whether they thought race should be considered in a judgement about someone's character, the large majority of Americans would say no - the civil rights act and california civil rights initiative proves it."

What makes me skeptical is that I doubt they'll implement it the right way.

Ivy league style affirmative action still creates a class of elites, albeit a more diverse one only in skin color. 

I just don't think the white man has our best interests at hand to actually make an effective system without being mandated to. Will they actually take all the subtle nuances into account, subgroups of race, generation, income, jobs of parents, family history, ESL, etc. and actually use them to create a more equitable system, or will they claim they are but just treat this as picking colors from the home depot paint store? They have every incentive to pick the latter, and if so, then we'd stand more to benefit from the system of economic affirmative action.

CrazyRichBayesians,,"> When you say that racial diversity is a goal we should strive for, do you mean that all colleges should have a student body with exactly the same racial demographics as the United States?

No, any more than we should make sure that these California universities have a perfect population distribution of people from each zip code in California. But the schools do owe it to their students and to their community to make sure that major demographic groups aren't missing entirely from their student body. If UC Berkeley were to admit a class of students and not a single one of the students is from San Diego, then something has gone wrong, and the state-funded institution isn't properly serving the entirety of the state that funds it.

> Nobody demands that all movies have a 3% asian cast, the NBA or NFL has 3% Asian players, or 3% of US politicians are Asian. 

No, but people do fight for the number to be ""not zero."" That's what I'm getting at. Even for a demographic that represents 3% of the population, proper representation requires a nonzero number of actors, athletes, politicians, judges, CEOs, police officers, doctors, teachers, etc. to hail from that demographic.

When Sally Ride was gearing up to be the first American woman in space, the NASA engineers asked her whether 100 tampons would be enough for her 7-day mission. That's a blind spot created by homogeneity. NASA didn't need for half of their engineers to be women to avoid that blind spot. They just needed one.

> The debate on whether race as a standalone quality should be used to judge people is already largely settled in the United States.

Hardship comes in a lot of forms. And race is a significant component of it. Society isn't race blind, so hardship isn't race blind. A rich black person has qualitatively different struggles from a rich white person, or even a poor white person, while a poor black person has qualitatively different struggles than either. When defining hardship, should that population be analyzed as two separate groups (poor and rich) or four (poor and rich, black and white)? If we want an accurate reflection of what hardship actually means, consciously ignoring the racial/ethnic groupings is consciously ignoring one facet of a very real hardship (or privilege) that some live.

And the reason why hardship is an important component of college admissions, but not other parts of society, is because college admissions is about much more than just choosing the ""best"" person for a role.

Race is part of the human experience, and drives how we perceive the world and how the world perceives us. And all parts of the human experience should be fair game for consideration in college admissions."
lt_daaaan,Taiwanese American,"> I used to hold that affirmative action was merely bandaging the symptoms of systematic inequality.

That was my perspective, too, 16 years ago when I was getting into and when I was in college. Since then I've recognized that what I benefitted most from during that time was the diversity of perspectives I was exposed to. That that diversity is not fully representative of US demographics is a shame. Sure, there are other aspects of systematic inequality that can be addressed in order to deal with root causes, but that shouldn't mean that we can't apply solutions throughout the system.

On the other hand, there aren't really any ""old money"" mainland Chinese people (as far as I know, maybe the revolution wasn't as thorough as I was led to believe), so Chinese immigrants might be more likely to see their accomplishments as entirely a result of their own hard work. If you feel like your success was entirely based on merit, it's harder to accept that other people deserve more help than you or your kids.

One way to test this idea would be to compare attitudes towards affirmative action among Indian Americans by caste, I wonder if that's been done before."

NoIdentify,,"You make the point that we just need the number of URMs in colleges to be ""not zero"". If that's all you ask for, the current system already satisfies that: according to this [source](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance), 26% of students at UCs identify as URMs.

> If UC Berkeley were to admit a class of students and not a single one of the students is from San Diego, then something has gone wrong

Yup, but the solution to this problem isn't ""reserve a portion of student seats for students from San Diego"" or ""add a section where students can add their zip code so we can prioritize San Diegans"" The solution is look closely into **why** students from San Diego are underperforming, and treat the root cause of the problem, not the symptoms. Perhaps we could look into providing additional funding for K-12 schooling for San Diegan neighborhoods, or reimplement K-12 standards so San Diegans are better prepared for college.

> Society isn't race blind, so hardship isn't race blind. A rich black person has qualitatively different struggles from a rich white person, or even a poor white person, while a poor black person has qualitatively different struggles than either.

That's true, but race is the simplest and one of the least descriptive metrics for diversity. People pay extra attention to it because it's the most obviously visible, but it struggles to maintain cohesion when examined more closely. Every single person has a different upbringing, and the core idea behind being against racism for me is that people should not be judged for factors beyond their control, like their skin color.

For example, ask any asian person how much they identify with another asian person. Perhaps they would have some similar cultural aspects - they might both celebrate the lunar new year, or might both joke about how their parents forced them to study more when they were kids. That's about it. I know as an asian person, I would identify much more closely with any fellow student from my high school than any of the 4.5 billion people in Asia, but in the section of the UC application that asks about race, I would be grouped together with those 4.5 billion people in a bucket labeled ""asian"".

Taking race into consideration in college applications is an inelegant facade of a solution that fails to solve the real problem of systemic racism that America has. College administrators want their college demographics to resemble those of the US so people can look at their demographics and pretend that the problem is solved. In reality, attempting to equalize outcomes will do nothing to address the fundamental problems disadvantaged minority communities suffer from. We can already see symptoms of this: black and hispanic people are oftentimes (sometimes justly, sometimes unjustly) regarded as less capable than their peers who graduate from the exact same university due to the lower admission standards they benefit from. In tech companies, female, black, or hispanic engineers are sometimes regarded as ""diversity"" candidates who received their job only because of their gender or the color of their skin. If the current trend of weak medical school admission standards for URMs continue, I bet we will see a trend in the future where black or URM doctors are trusted less than asian or white doctors because of their lower admission standards.

Without addressing the symptoms of the problems, and by equalizing for outcomes rather than for opportunity, we will eventually make racism a bigger problem than it already is - people will just pretend it's gone while minority communities continue to suffer."
ClocktowerEchos,,"Piggybacking off of this, I have my own theory as to why this is as an ABC. 

I think part of it is that the Chinese mentality of being better than everyone hasn't ever quite gone away. For the longest time China was basically the closest to a pre-modern uperpower with everyone in that part of the world giving some form of tribute to the grand old Dragon Throne for some odd 1000 years. Then it gets shafted during the Age of Imperialism, sent all the way down, tore itself apart, had its own fun with Daddy Mao's plans and eventually came back on top to a place where it could contend on the world stage.

Again, entirely based on anecdotes and my own sights, but I feel like the old pride, the bruised ego and then the Chinese Dream success story had a lot of this reinvergerate of ""we were the best, we got bet and now we're the best again"". Plus like you said, its often only the best and the top percent that can emigrate to the US and big egos tend to follow success."

CrazyRichBayesians,,"> the solution to this problem

Well, there's a layer of complexity that comes from certain things being in the control of different people. The same people who make decisions about how to select applicants for admission into a university are *not* the same people who decide how to fund school lunch or day care or lead abatement, and might not be in the position to design k-12 curricula that can factor in the cultural reality that not every student has the same circumstances.

What universities and their admissions committees *can* do is decide what their role in society should be. Admissions isn't a ""solution"" to a ""problem,"" in a backwards looking way, but a forward-looking policy decision on what roles you want the graduates of your institution to play in the future. The same degree doesn't open the same doors for different people. That degree might mean one thing to a star athlete, to a Senator's kid, to an international student who wants to permanently immigrate to the U.S., to the prince of a foreign monarchy who will use that education and connections to rule back home, to the kid of poor rural farmers, etc. The applicants aren't fungible, interchangeable cogs in our society. That's why college admission isn't a prize for past performance, and why affirmative action isn't a solution to past discrimination.

> Perhaps they would have some similar cultural aspects - they might both celebrate the lunar new year, or might both joke about how their parents forced them to study more when they were kids. That's about it.

When I was young, I primarily socialized with other Asians. Not just other Chinese American (and I grew up in a time and place when those Chinese Americans were basically separated into children of immigrants from Hong Kong and children of immigrants from Taiwan), but also Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Thai kids. We were grouped together, both by external and internal social forces. That's a shared experience.

And the Asian immigrant experience has strong shared ties. By the time I got outside of my comfort zone and met a lot of children of white immigrants and black immigrants, the reality of growing up bilingual and having a foot in both worlds was very different for them than it was for me (and all my Korean, Vietnamese, other Asian friends).

So there's much more shared experience and common culture between Asian Americans than your comment seems to suggest.

And, in any event, I don't think anyone is advocating for a crude form of affirmative action where black applicants from Ethiopia are naively categorized in the same group as black applicants from Sacramento, or for Asian applicants from Taipei to be categorized in the same group as Asian applicants from Los Angeles. When I advocate for race to be a factor, I'm by no means pushing for race to be the only factor, or the biggest factor. Just a factor."

Yes and no - the law itself doesn't distinguish between affirmative action and racial discrimination. The legal test for affirmative action is the same test (strict scrutiny) as applied to any race-conscious policy. 

To pass strict scrutiny, there has to be a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored/least restrictive means to achieving that interest. Obviously, there is no compelling government interest in a policy that prefers whites to POC, which is why racial discrimination fails the test.

For affirmative action, IIRC the ""compelling government interest"" element is not that controversial. It's the ""narrowly tailored/least restrictive means"" test that gets more attention - whether other race-blind methods (income-based, top 10% of all high schools, etc.) would be effective."

The question is quite open-ended and most people including myself would interpret it as including stuff like resource/outreach programs (i.e access to books, tutoring, mentoring, misc college admissions resources, etc.) 

In contrast, a Survey USA [poll](https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d15fdb0d-701d-495c-a67f-e17bfcc3bf92) is worded more specifically:

> ""The next statewide ballot measure, Proposition 16, would allow diversity to be considered as a factor in public employment, education, and contracting decisions. Are you ...?""

Not saying this doesn’t happen to those of other ethnicities, but this is the flaw within Kaizen.

To put it another way, what is a level playing field?  But I still agree that reducing admissions criteria to something as shallow as skin color is stupid.

This lower level quality of statistical evidence doesn't provide proof that such an employer is discriminating against Asians. But the Harvard case opens the door for such to be sufficient.

Regardless of what issue, we should all be concerned about what quality of evidence the courts are using to determine if there is a racial bias.

Does the fact that my White co-workers make more than me enough to prove that our employer has a racial bias even though they all have at least 10 more years of work experience than me?

Does that fact that Asians on average score better on the ACT and SAT than African Americans and Hispanics mean that the tests are racially biased?

Does the fact that on average women make less  than men enough to prove wage discrimination?

Does the fact the McDonalds hires more people under 65 than over 65 mean its involved in age discrimination?

If we are willing to lower the quality of evidence to prove discrimination, are we also willing to lower the quality of evidence to determine guilt in criminal cases?

To many people are basing their opinions on the case without even having gone through the evidence. Its sad so many are willing to cast judgement that way.  It makes me wonder how much longer the courts will require evidence at all and instead simply rely on popular opinion."

When it comes to the fact that there are a limited number of seats, there's going to be collateral. I believe that if it leads to increasing access to historically marginalized groups, then, oh well, a few Asians didn't get in. But Harvard is already something like 25% Asian, and let's be honest - if you actually have a decent shot at Harvard, you're doing pretty good! Many Asian Americans in the past few decades have benefited from affirmative action policies, and wouldn't be where they are today if there weren't policies designed to increase access to underrepresented groups. There are still underrepresented Asians in higher education, like southeast Asians.

Just talk to people who went to Harvard. Did you appreciate the fact that the student body isn't 80% white? Did you think you benefited and learned from being around people of different ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultures? I think most people who went to Harvard would say yes."

SFFA is basically arguing that Harvard's admission policy discriminates against Asians and favors Blacks and Hispanics even though Asians make up nearly 14% of the undergraduate student body while Black and Hispanics make up 10% and 6% of student body respectively. 

If it wasn't for this policy of favoring Blacks and Hispanics over Asians, SFFA is claiming that Harvard's  Asian undergraduate student population would be greater than 14%.

To establish this, the analysis conducted by Prof. Arcidiacono excludes non-academic metrics such as high school quality, economic disadvantage, and personal disadvantage. The analysis conducted by Prof. Card which includes such factors, finds that Harvards policy does not favor Blacks and Hispanics over Asians. Prof. Card's analysis is also supported by the countries foremost experts on the matter on race and education. (Full disclosure: One of those experts that signed the amicus brief in support of Prof. Cards analysis was my graduate thesis advisor).

Also, it is important to remember that SFFA doesn't so much have problem with Harvard having a policy that favors racial minorities.  Rather, its problem is that Harvard policy favors certain racial minorities more than others when it should favor all racial minorities equally."

But, 74% of Indian-Americans have at least a college degree (33% bachelors, 40% graduate degree) compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites (20.9% bachelors, 11.7% graduate). 

So Indians are about 46% more likely to be CEO compared to white people but 125% more likely to have at least a bachelors degree (and 233% more likely to have a graduate degree). That doesn't point to ""overrepresentation relative to whites"" in my eyes or arguably even overrepresentation overall.

meister2983,,"Few technical notes.

* 107 million adults 25 and older have college degrees. (associates or higher)
* By your data, 3.1 million Indians have college degrees in 2017.
* 2.6% of CEOs were Indian vs. 2.9% of degree holders. Perhaps underrepresented on this naive calculation.
* Of course, there's heavy immigration coming in. No one immigrates and immediately becomes a CEO.  If you back up even 7 years (to 2010) in that paper, you get something like 2.6% of today's CEOs are Indian on 2.3% of 2010 college grads (overrepresented).
* 7 year backup of course is still too low. Realistically, it's 20+ years to become CEO after living in America (Satya at 24 years, Nooyi at 22, etc.).  More backup implies more overrepresentation relative to the initial pipeline.
* There's serious age bias here without strong controls - the non-working elderly population has lower educational attainment. Going by US census [data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html), it's 46% of 25-30 years have college degrees.  51% of non-Hispanic whites and 75% of Asian alone (they don't disaggregate).  That would put the two ratios you calculated roughly in-line between Indian and white and factoring immigration biases probably imply Indians are actually more represented than whites.

Secondly, I'm not even sure if ""degree holders"" is the right control; it's heavily biased by immigration (you basically need a degree to immigrate here, but you can be a white collar worker without a degree).

The correct question is, among the US born population in the relevant workforce, across different age buckets, which groups are overrepresented? I'd be surprised if the order wasn't Indian slightly above white and much greater than East Asian.  It certainly felt that way from companies I've worked with.   The MBA pipeline data suggests this; do you have counter data that analyzes the native born pipeline?

>East Asians strongly underperform relative to educational attainment which is a huge problem of course. But sometimes there is this narrative that Indian-Americans are totally fine and don't face workplace discrimination which is straight up false.

If this is Harvard’s idea of “diversity,” it’s a white-down vision that rewards students for acting, in essence, more like wealthy white kids.  
>  
>But the emphasis on the essay revealed a much more troubling standard. Harvard, in essence, is saying that if you want your race to count, you need to prove to us why it matters. Or perhaps, to be more precise, when you write an essay to present who you are to the most prestigious college in the country, you should reduce your life to a moment of trauma.

Asian-Americans basically have to prove that they're not the stereotypical, ""grade-grubbing"" (as Kang describes it), quiet, studious, STEM-focused Asian-American student to do well on the personality score. Alum interviewers might already have an unconscious bias of Asian-American students being like that and looking for ways that the candidates adhere to that stereotype.

This brings to mind sociologist Annette Lareau's book ""Unequal Childhoods"". She mentions that children from more privileged backgrounds are raised to question authority since they see their parents doing so whereas children from less privileged backgrounds are taught to keep their heads down. Children from the former group would rank higher on Harvard's personality score since they would be ""exhibiting intellectual curiosity"" (i.e. not just accepting what an authority figure tells you as truth)."

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"For the purposes of this article, Alex Chen, an 18-year-old senior at the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, is the “typical Asian student.” Alex has a 98 percent average at one of the city’s elite public high schools, scored a 1,580 on the SAT and, as far as he knows, has earned the respect of his teachers. Alex is also the vice president of technology for the Bronx Science chapter of the National Honor Society, the director of graphics and marketing for TeenHacks L.I. (“the first hackathon for teens in Long Island”), a member of the cross-country team, the vice president of the school’s painting club, the president of the Get Your Life Together club (visitors from various businesses come talk to students) and the senator for his homeroom. In his free time, he plays Pokémon and goes on long jogs through Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. His parents, Qiao and Su, emigrated from China in the ’90s and worked their way through commuter colleges in Queens. They live along with Alex’s little brother in a modest apartment in outer Queens. In the specific yet ultimately abstracted and perhaps inhuman calculations particular to selective college admissions, Alex is a first-generation (considered a plus), middle-class (minus) Chinese-American (minus, arguably) with two college-educated parents (minus) from a major American city (minus) with aspirations to study either computer science (minus, given all the Asians who want to go into STEM disciplines) or political science (plus).

When I first met him in early August 2018, we struggled to find a time to meet up to talk about his thoughts on affirmative action and its effect on Asian-American students. Deep into the summer vacation before his last year of high school, Alex had been interning in the office of Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou while also completing a study on congressional legislators with a professor at New York University. There just was no time.

After Alex canceled our first agreed-upon date, I told him that in addition to writing for The New York Times Magazine, I was also writing a book, ran a small production company and had an 18-month-old daughter. And yet, despite these various jobs (as well as the fact that I wasn’t on summer vacation), I could meet him on any day and at any time for however long he pleased. My flexible schedule wasn’t a favor to him but simply a reflection of the life of a relatively productive adult.

“Well, that’s you,” Alex said, a bit scornfully.

We finally settled on a meeting in the financial district. Alex suggested a Dunkin’ Donuts exactly one door down from his internship office. When I arrived, I saw that it had no tables or booths, just three stools pushed up against the front window. I was hungry and slightly irritated, so I texted him and said I’d meet him at a Cuban lunch counter nearby. He walked through the front door a moment later — thin, with short-cropped hair, a neatly tucked button-up shirt and creaseless pants. He had a look of mild agitation about him, one that never really subsided. We shook hands.

“This is my list of priorities for the summer,” he said, opening a document on his phone. “You can see the sociology study is way up high because it’s really important to me, and cross-country is less high but still important.”

“Do you enjoy running?” I asked.

“Sometimes,” he said. “Do you want to see my list of colleges?”
“I believe the existence of affirmative action reflects the countless historical injustices that have led to such a complex situation, and any single person or perspective, much less a short photo caption, can’t possibly capture its nuances. But I absolutely think that our generation’s willingness to discuss the hard topics of race and class and privilege will eventually lead to a satisfactory solution for everybody, even beyond college admissions.”
He pulled up a spreadsheet on his phone with the names of 11 colleges listed in color-coded columns. “So, Binghamton and Rochester are the safeties, which is great, because I’d be totally thrilled to go to both. Carnegie Mellon and Rice are matches where I’m pretty sure I can get in. And these schools in red are my reaches.” Yale, M.I.T., Cornell, Princeton, Stanford, Vanderbilt and Brown.

“Would you really be happy going to Binghamton or Rochester?” I asked.

“Yes, because the value would be there for the price I’ll end up paying. They’re great schools and cheap.”“I see Harvard isn’t on your list,” I said. “Are you worried it’ll be impossible because of ... you know.”

“I’m applying to Yale.”

“Sure,” I said. “But Harvard is Harvard.”

“Yes, and Yale is Yale,” he said.

“Do you want to go to Yale?” I asked.

“Define ‘want,’ ” he said.

It went on like this for a while. After a brief discussion about his internship and what it taught him about the importance of local political representation, I finally asked him how he felt about affirmative action.

“It’s complicated,” Alex said. “I understand why it exists and why it might be necessary to create the society we all want,” he went on. “But I also understand there are ideas that make it seem like Asians aren’t discriminated against at all.”

“What ideas?” I asked.

He gave me a look that communicated his deep, and perhaps justified, frustration with me. These ideas, I gathered, had been implicit in every conversation Alex had ever had about college admissions, but they rarely found clear expression. “So how do you feel about affirmative action?” I asked again.

“I understand the thinking behind affirmative action, but I just wish the message wasn’t that Asians are all so privileged and rich and buying their way into colleges,” he said, referring to the perception that Asian parents in effect buy their kids’ test scores through expensive preparation programs and private tutoring. “And I wish that it didn’t mean that my work didn’t count in the same way as other people’s work.”
This was an unsatisfying answer but not an uncommon one. In 2014, an organization with the cryptic name Students for Fair Admissions filed a lawsuit against Harvard College on behalf of Asian-American applicants who claimed they had been victims of discrimination and bias. In August 2018, the Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the case, arguing against Harvard’s motion to dismiss it and claiming that “Harvard has failed to prove that its use of race survives strict scrutiny.” Following all the attention that action received, I began asking Asian kids across the country about affirmative action, which was widely seen to be the real issue.

The case, which after a lengthy trial last autumn is expected to be decided by Judge Allison D. Burroughs sometime in the coming months, has pushed many Asian-Americans into a spotlight they had eagerly been avoiding for the past 20 years. The students felt uneasy, and perhaps unworthy, discussing race, especially within a context where they were personally implicated. As such, many refused to go on the record for fear of saying something controversial. The opinions ranged from “We shouldn’t be punished for doing well” to “We all need to sacrifice to make a better, more just society.” Most of them said they had always known it would be harder for them to get into college, but only a few called this an injustice. There was nothing approaching a consensus, but they were, for the most part, extremely conflicted and embarrassed by the whole business.

Their internal conflict, however inchoate and strangled by euphemism, paled next to the angst of what I’ll call the upwardly mobile Asian-American population — the sort of people who had attended Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Stanford and who, in other circumstances, would have publicly and loudly supported any goal pursued in the name of diversity. Over the past year, I found myself constantly talking about the Harvard case with this cohort, many of them friends and colleagues, not only for journalistic reasons but also because it was always on our minds. These conversations usually started with perfunctory statements like “Listen, I know I’m not supposed to say this” or “This is a complicated issue,” but they almost always ended with a surprisingly declarative conclusion.

“Look, I support Harvard’s right to pursue the diversity they want,” said one Asian-American who described herself as a “staunch supporter of affirmative action.” “But of course they discriminate against Asian kids.”On the first day of the trial for Students for Fair Admissions (S.F.F.A.) v. the President and Fellows of Harvard College, which took place over three weeks in late 2018, a problem presented itself: It was almost impossible to figure out who or what, exactly, was on trial. In his opening statement, Adam K. Mortara, the lead attorney for S.F.F.A. and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, declared, “The future of affirmative action is not on trial.” Then he added, “Diversity and its benefits are not on trial.” This came as news to the dozens of Asian-American activists who had traveled to Boston to support the lawsuit, as well as the gallery of reporters who piled into the stiff, unyielding press benches in Courtroom 17 of the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston with assignments to cover “the affirmative-action trial.”"
SuperNaCl,,"My friends ask me what injustices Asian Americans suffer, and when I list stuff like this, they just say I’m racist towards other minorities and that the other minorities have it worse."
,,"I'm conflicted. While I feel that affirmative action can be unfair I also dislike the intensely competitive environment that it fosters for top-name schools. I mean, I'm in my 30s, and after being more than a decade out I don't really see any difference in terms of professional success for my asian friends who went to top schools, and my asian friends who didn't. Honest-to-goodness."
InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"People often joke about the ""Oppression Olympics,"" but one disturbing thought that really jumped out at me while reading this article is that an *ideal* (!) holistic admissions process that is sensitive to diversity and affirmative action concerns essentially asks applicants to compete with each other in the Oppression Olympics. As if that weren't bad enough, these admissions officers sit as the judges in these Olympic Games for which there are no written rules, and they ask us to simply trust in their good judgment. Meanwhile, these judges have proven themselves untrustworthy time and time again (fighting to keep out Jews in the past and retaining policies to benefit the privileged). And of course, no matter how you judge the Oppression Olympics, there is no reasonable calculation that would say that white people are more oppressed than Asians.

The short of it is that holistic admissions gives admissions officers a power that no one should have, really. The opacity of the process reduces the whole thing to, ""Trust us. We're the good guys.""

On the other hand, I'm also not a fan of the so-called ""objective meritocratic"" approach either, in part because I do believe in the goals of diversity and affirmative action. I don't know what the answer is, but I do feel strongly that the status quo is bullshit."
,,"The problem with discussing ""Asians"" in college admissions vis a vi affirmative action, it almost exclusively refers to East Asians. Southeast Asians who are left behind by the educational system are lumped with East Asians who tend to bo better in schools. How many Hmongs or Cambodians make it to the Ivy League even? 

If California has not abolished race considerations in admissions, how many Southeast Asians would be put into a ""wait list"" simply because they were ""Asians"" and there's ""too many Asians"" in school

Unless they disaggregate Asians, I don't think affirmative action will be any good esp to Southeast Asians"

doudoucow,,"Wow, I really appreciate this article for its in-depth view of Affirmative Action. I don't know how important it is for me to post something, but maybe this is just my way of mentally processing. 

One of the things that always comes to mind is how damaging the word ""Asian"" really is. Yes, there are similarities and bits of borrowed culture across different peoples of Asia, but to lump us all together just always rubs me the wrong way. I will always claim my Hmong ethnicity and culture before ""Asian."" At the same time, I do think there's a sense of camaraderie to be had between the peoples of Asia. 

Something I constantly question, though, is how much of this camaraderie is natural and how much of it is manufactured by White America. And yes, I do say ""White"" America because the roots of ""orientalism"" trail back to French and British folk who would then become the people to populate the US. Historically speaking, the Hmong people have been and continue to be oppressed in most Asian countries. There's even history of the enslavement of Hmong people in parts of China. I don't think this is unique to Hmong people, I think this is pretty common for all ethnic and cultural minorities of Asia--such as the Rohingya of Myanmar for example. I'm so torn. Because while I do appreciate that I can put that history aside given the new opportunities available in America, does it also mean I'm buying into the White narrative that *granted* ""honorary whiteness"" to Asians even before my people arrived here? 

And then when this feeds into the whole college system, I'm then led to continually question our system of higher education which was designed by white people for white people. While attempts have been made to alleviate the cultural-centrism of education, there are still things that people either can't let go of or choose not to let go of because we haven't found a better way yet. 

I believe in the power of affirmative action, but I also don't think it's enough. I don't think it's enough to just push someone into school because of the color of their skin. I went to UW-Madison, a huge top 10 public school, and getting into the school was only one hurdle. The culture of the campus and academics weren't designed for the success of all, and I struggled immensely without that cultural knowledge. As a teacher, I believe to my core that education is inherently flawed and needs major reform to become more culturally sensitive and culturally relevant to best serve the current and future American populations. I don't have clear answers for this, but it's something I do think about often. 

One of my greatest challenges is encouraging my students of color to go to college. Yes, I want all of them to have the opportunity to go to college and then have the opportunities that come with a college degree (career choices, grad school, etc.), but also I know college is really freakin hard for kids of color who go through 12 years of school often not knowing how to ""play the game"" and see education as an equalizer. I find myself having to teach kids how to ""play the game,"" and it kinda feels dirty because I see maybe 20 kids of color off to college versus the thousands across the US. How the heck to I help them all? And maybe I'm foolish to think I can or that I should help them all, but we need to. We need to help *every* student succeed, and that only comes from changes to the broken system."

In case you thought this guy's name was familiar, here's where you may seen it before: an October 2018 article titled [Michael Wang Didn't Get Into Harvard. He Thinks It's Because He's Asian.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/estherwang/chinese-americans-harvard-affirmative-action-asian-americans)

ICYMI, here's the sub's past discussion of this article: [https://old.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9o6mrl/michael\_wang\_didnt\_get\_into\_harvard\_he\_thinks\_its/](https://old.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9o6mrl/michael_wang_didnt_get_into_harvard_he_thinks_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

And here are some of the positions Michael chose to take, which had me going [u serious, brah??](https://media.giphy.com/media/tITrNs91St95hYoOoC/giphy.gif)

>Michael told me he recognizes the importance of racial diversity. “Being stuck on a \[predominantly\] white campus made me feel bad too,” he said, recalling his time at Williams. Yet both he and his father seem comfortable with the prospect of having fewer black and Latino students on campus — the [likely outcome](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/at-elite-colleges-racial-diversity-requires-affirmative-action.html) if race-based affirmative action were eliminated — if it means that Asian students benefit.

>“Are they really working hard like Asians?” Jeff posed. I asked him if the idea of a majority Asian American student body gave him pause. “What’s wrong with that?” he said.  
>  
>Ultimately, college admission is a zero-sum game, Michael said. As he put it, “Someone has to lose for someone else to win.”

&#x200B;

>Blum is “an ally in this fight for equality,” Michael Wang told me. He had initially reached out to Blum as he was researching Abigail Fisher’s case, and they’ve stayed in touch. **Some of his stances, like his gutting of the Voting Rights Act, give Michael pause. “But I think as long as the end goal is good, I don’t mind it as much,” he said.**

Judging by his comment for NYT, seems like Michael's become more cautious about what he says and is less explicit about his support for Blum and SFFA. But reading between the lines of his comment, I don't think his views have changed much, if at all. He's still young so I was hoping he'd show some growth.

Edit 1: Clarified a sentence and edited formatting.

Edit 2: The law school that this young man will be attending ranks below the top 100. Interesting, seeing as he was so obsessed with prestige that he thought that Williams (the #1 ranked liberal arts college in the U.S.) wasn't good enough for him."
LookOutItsLiuBei,,"Before we attack each other and other minorities, let's not forget that as soon as they do away with affirmative action and base it on merits, I'm going to bet white people will start bitching that there are too many asians in college. Hell, they say that already."
Basilone1917,,"Harvard's class size hasn't changed in decades while the world's population has gone up by a couple billion people.

Maybe the problem isn't affirmative action but Ivy league colleges choosing to never expand?"
bad-monkey,,"Affirmative Action doesn't just cover college admissions which are less important than you are led to believe, in the grand scheme of things, but also public procurement for local, state, and federal governments. 

It means that the City of San Francisco can apply structural advantages to small/local businesses, that LA County DPW can mandate that large, multinational corporations use women/veteran/disabled/minority owned businesses. It's how NYC can demand that 20% of every public construction contract goes to a NYC small business. 

This narrow minded attack on AA in college admissions is a shortsighted, foolish tilt at what is a very productive windmill, especially for the Asian American community, which is one of the most small-business centered communities in America. This is the **direct** wealth transfer of public money to our community (however you slice and dice that word) in exchange for needed services."

AwesomeAsian,Japanese/American,I don't mind affirmative action as long as it tries to be fair. I think it's far more important to have a diverse student body than a student body that scores 2400s on the SAT.

This case is being tried before [Allison Burroughs](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/burroughs-allison-dale), an Obama nominee to the Massachusetts US District Court.

Also, this part gets me thinking about Asian culture and legacy admissions:

> Roughly 30 percent of the seats in every Harvard class go to athletes, legacies, the children of faculty and applicants on the dean’s interest list, composed in large part of the children of donors. This group, called A.L.D.C.s, get into Harvard at a rate of about 45 percent, far greater than the 5 percent rate for the rest of the pool. Two percent of Asian applicants are A.L.D.C.s. The zero-sum view of this arrangement never asks why the spots for more Asian kids couldn’t come from the pool of A.L.D.C.s.

Contrast it with this anecdote about the father of the main speaker in this story:

> Alex’s father, Qiao, immigrated to the United States in 1994, when he was 21. He grew up in poverty in the countryside of Fujian Province. He describes his hometown as a thoroughly corrupt place where people like him could not get anything done without bribing a local official.

For the most part, Asian parents have been ""play by the rules and work hard to get ahead"" types. The cold reality that Ivy League schools are not purely meritocracies but rather insular tribes for ""the right"" kinds of ""the best"" (white, wealthy, from posh parts of the country and old money) inspires certain opposition to affirmative action from Asian activists. Can anyone name any buildings in elite universities named after Asian-Americans? Let me try:

* Stanford: The [Li Ka Shing Center](https://conferencecenter.stanford.edu/) at the medical school, named after [a Hong Kong billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ka-shing).

* Berkeley: The business school [has a learning lab](https://newbuilding.haas.berkeley.edu/). named after Connie & Kevin Chou. [Kevin Chou](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2019-06-12/game-changer-introducing-cal-alumnus-year-kevin-chou) is a 2002 alum and video game developer whose parents are Taiwanese immigrants. However most of the Asian ""naming rights"" have gone to overseas Asians not Asian Americans. The [Tang Center](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/home) for health services, which [came from a $4m donation from the Tang Foundation](https://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/96legacy/chron.html) in honor of [Jack Tang](https://asiasociety.org/hong-kong/memory-dr-jack-tang-chi-chien), a Hong Kong entrepreneur. [Tan Hall](https://dac.berkeley.edu/tan-hall), part of the disability compliance center, was named after [Tan Kah Kee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Kah_Kee), who had died over 35 years earlier and whose philanthropy was mostly in China and Singapore during his lifetime. The [Woo Hon Fai Hall](https://dac.berkeley.edu/woo-hon-fai-hall) in the same area was [donated by his son](https://news.berkeley.edu/2011/12/19/hong-kong-businessman-honors-father-woo-hon-fai-with-major-gift-to-uc-berkeley/) who was the architect behind the university's art museum and film archive.

It's getting late, and I lack the time to find any similarly named facilities in eastern schools - but I wonder if Asian-Americans tried investing in more social capital like getting buildings named after themselves they could shatter the ""bamboo ceiling""?"

SelenaGomezFanYes,,"Affirmative action helps Asians.

When you talk about how hard it is to get into top colleges because of affirmative action, you need to also ask the Asians to stop applying to just top colleges, spread out to the other colleges too.

Just because you can't go to Harvard doesn't mean its the end of the world. Go apply to Emory, Syracuse, or the other also-awesome schools."
Lintrix,,"Surprised nobody here mentions that their hero, Andrew Yang, thinks it's okay Asian Americans are discriminated against in college admissions at Harvard."
nosotros_road_sodium,Chinese-American,"> This brings to mind sociologist Annette Lareau's book ""Unequal Childhoods"". She mentions that children from more privileged backgrounds are raised to question authority since they see their parents doing so whereas children from less privileged backgrounds are taught to keep their heads down. Children from the former group would rank higher on Harvard's personality score since they would be ""exhibiting intellectual curiosity"" (i.e. not just accepting what an authority figure tells you as truth).

Speaking of which - I wonder why more Asian parents don't consider schools like BYU, Liberty, or Baylor, because those schools seem to be about ""accepting what an authority figure tells you as truth"" (authority figures being the Bible, pastors, ""the right"" religious doctrine...)

(OK, I get that BYU has a significant Pacific Islander population owing to LDS missionaries' outreach to places like American Samoa and Hawaii.)"

A majority of schools that Asian Americans are being adversely affected by affirmative action are just breeding grounds to groom the next generation of social elites. That’s why most of the prerequisites are based on arbitrary measuring sticks like the SAT and ACT, which scores can be bought through tutoring programs. It’s not about exceptional students, it’s about maintaining social and financial hegemony."
unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"A thin man sat in the back of the courtroom in a suit two sizes bigger than what’s fashionable these days. Every now and then he would jot down something in a notebook and then return to watching dispassionately with his hands folded in his lap. This was Edward Blum, the 67-year-old president of S.F.F.A., and paradoxically enough, given that he is a white man with no direct connection to the school, the only person named on the side of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Harvard. Blum is not a lawyer or a politician, but he may be the most influential and effective opponent in the country of any progressive policy that tries to distinguish people by race and ethnicity. He exerts influence, in large part, because of his connections to wealthy conservative donors, but also from an indefatigable resolve to flood the legal system with lawsuits, some of which eventually make it to the Supreme Court.

In addition to S.F.F.A., Blum also heads the Project on Fair Representation, the litigation fund behind Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin, the last major challenge to affirmative action to reach the Supreme Court, in which Abigail Fisher, a white woman, was one of two women claiming to have been rejected from a spot she deserved because of preferences given to people of color. On two separate occasions within the last decade, Blum and his attorneys argued that the University of Texas was placing too much weight on race in nonautomatic admissions. Blum lost this challenge in 2016, but he has also done quite a bit of winning: In 2013, he won a landmark decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the key provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by effectively ending federal oversight of elections. Blum would not be taking the stand in the Harvard case.

A sweeping elimination of affirmative action still requires the cooperation of the Supreme Court, which was responsible for another odd dynamic in the trial. A vast majority of the testimony and argumentation was about Asian-Americans, but the actual lawsuit unfolded in a way that didn’t have much to do with Asians at all. The inevitability of an appeal, which would then raise the stakes, made the entire trial feel somewhat like an opening act. At the #DefendDiversity rally at the start of the trial, Jessica Tang, president of the Boston Teachers Union and a Harvard alumna, said that “Edward Blum is not a friend to Asian-Americans” and accused him of using Asian-Americans as pawns in a vile legal game. S.F.F.A. was making three broad claims:

One: Harvard’s use of racial preferences far exceeded the Supreme Court’s allowance of race as “one, nonpredominant factor in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual,” as Justice Anthony Kennedy described it in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. A landmark affirmative-action ruling, it involved the University of Michigan Law School and upheld the principle that race is only supposed to be a “plus” that is considered when two applicants are otherwise indistinguishable. In those instances, race can be a “tip” that allows a university to seek the diversity it desires.

Two: Harvard, by keeping black, Latino and Asian admissions rates at a relatively steady equilibrium, despite demographic changes in its applicant pool, had created a de facto quota system. Quotas have been illegal since the Supreme Court’s 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the first major challenge to affirmative action in higher education.

Three: Harvard had not adequately explored race-neutral alternatives required by the legal parameters of affirmative action. This requirement was reaffirmed in Fisher v. University of Texas, allowing a school to consider an applicant’s race only when “no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.”

Despite what Mortara said about affirmative action not being on trial, S.F.F.A. has been extremely forthright about its expectation that regardless of Burroughs’s decision, it will eventually be arguing in front of the Supreme Court. Over the course of the past year, I asked Blum on a few occasions what he hoped to get out of all this. His stance never changed. His “mission,” he told me again in August, is to remove race from college admissions: “We believe that a student’s skin color or ethnic heritage should not be used to help or harm that student’s prospects of being admitted to a college or university.” When I asked if the ultimate goal, then, was to end racial preferences not only in college admissions but also in all parts of the law, Blum said: “Yes! Absolutely. I won’t deny it.”
To get to the Supreme Court, S.F.F.A. needed to justify the lawsuit both in the courtroom and to the public. According to Blum, Abigail Fisher, the daughter of a family friend, had suffered greatly from her years of national attention as a result of her case against the University of Texas. To avoid putting another young person through the same thing and to bring a fresh angle to the fight, Blum and his attorneys decided to represent an anonymous and amorphous group of plaintiffs. (Every request I made to talk to any of these unnamed persons was denied by S.F.F.A.’s attorneys.) They chose, instead, to build a case out of spreadsheets and statistical data obtained through pretrial discovery, which in turn set up something of a phantom showdown: Students were discussed almost entirely through the abstraction of test scores, grades and extracurricular accomplishments. In their opening and closing statements, the attorneys for S.F.F.A. went through charts and spreadsheets, many of which were centered on something called the “personal rating,” a portion of Harvard’s application review that judges traits like “courage,” “openness to new ideas and people” and “effervescence.”“Harvard, and many other institutions of higher education throughout the country, could not accomplish its mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders of the world without a diverse student body. As a first-generation, low-income Vietnamese-American college student, I refuse to allow S.F.F.A. to paint Asian-Americans with a broad stroke. I refuse to be used as a tool to further divide communities of color.”
Their charts showed that Asian-American applicants outperformed white applicants in academics and extracurriculars and lagged behind in athletics and legacy considerations. When it came to the personal rating, Asian applicants rated significantly worse. Harvard never convincingly explained or contested the disparity.

Harvard’s defense, argued by Bill Lee, a 69-year-old Chinese-American attorney and a graduate of the class of 1972, was mostly predictable, if not entirely coherent. On one front, Harvard resorted to bureaucratic denial: It claimed that every piece of information, however damning, had to be placed within the context of the entire admissions process. And while Lee took great pains to detail how an application went through an initial reader and then an alumni interviewer and then a subcommittee and then the final 40-person committee, he never addressed the specifics of how decisions were made, except to say that the committee considered “the whole person.” In the end, the only definitive, knowable thing about the admissions process was that race was said to be only one small part of an opaque process.

On the other front, Harvard and its allies went on an ideological offensive. The multicultural and empathetic vision of the country — represented on Harvard’s side by lawyers of all races and a steady stream of Asian, black and Latino students who gave testimony about why they, despite less than perfect test scores and G.P.A.s, deserved to be on campus — would not be possible without the tireless efforts of places like the Harvard admissions office to change the face of elite society in America. Lee ended his opening statement with a personal anecdote: Forty-two years earlier, when he argued his first case in front of a federal judge, every person in the courtroom, save the deputy, was a white man. “Look around the courtroom today,” Lee said. “Many institutions, many people have contributed and worked tirelessly to make this happen. Among them are colleges and universities.”

This could easily have been seen as a shot at S.F.F.A.’s cross-examining lawyers, who were all white. But Harvard’s story made even less sense than S.F.F.A.’s. The array of amicus speakers gave breathless testimony about the dangers of gaslighting and the crippling self-doubt that comes with being told that your feelings of alienation and racial othering are all imagined or not worthy of concern. Then Lee stood up and told the judge that S.F.F.A.’s own claims of implicit racial bias were outrageous, because Harvard admissions were an unknowably complicated, nuanced and sensitive process that involved 40 thoroughly trained people."

startledapple,,"Usually I don't reply to these types of comments, but your argument doesn't make sense. Full disclosure: I am neither for nor against affirmative action based on race, although I favor providing a boost to applicants based on socioeconomic status.

>Affirmative Action doesn't just cover college admissions which are less important than you are led to believe, in the grand scheme of things, but also public procurement for local, state, and federal governments...City of San Francisco can apply structural advantages to small/local businesses

Affirmative action at the federal and state levels only notes that public institutions (and entities receiving funds from governments, at risk of withdrawal of public funds) cannot provide preferential treatment or discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, and so forth. The fact that federal, state, or municipality funds can be allocated according to other characteristics (e.g. small business) is not an aspect of affirmative action. Indeed, these funds can be allocated however these institutions wish them to be, as long as they do not discriminate against the individuals receiving those funds (again, race, creed, color, sex).

It's an important difference, and I think you are conflating allocation of public resources based on certain goals (e.g. to encourage small businesses with public resources or another example may be to fund early-stage researchers with NIH grants) with affirmative action, which are two entirely and very different separate notions.

I also find it interesting that you, as a Cal grad, and presumably an Asian American, are against affirmative action on a collegiate level. If proposition 209 was enforced state-wide, the Asian American population at top privates would probably be similar to UCLA and Cal's rate of 40% than the current \~20-25%."

Also, wealthy white people frequently game the system with their lavish donations, alumni connections, rigorous SAT prep classes, college admissions advisers and having their children designated as having ""special needs"" so they are given extra time on the SATs. 

Donald Trump was given admission to U Penn when his brother's close friend was his alumni interviewer."
unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"Lee and the Harvard admissions officers who were called to the stand also talked about the school’s endlessly adjustable process, which could take factors like standardized test scores and G.P.A.s and place them within the proper context. The goal in all this, of course, was to root out systemic racism and relative privilege. But when it came to explaining away the disparities in the personal rating, Harvard presented years of data showing that Asian-American applicants, despite superior academic and extracurricular ratings, uniformly received worse recommendations from their teachers and guidance counselors. Lee did not extrapolate on what this might mean, but there was really only one possible conclusion to draw: If there was bias in the personal ratings, it came from the teachers and guidance counselors, not from Harvard’s admissions officers. And Harvard, despite its complex and sensitive system calibrated to ferret out and correct bias, apparently took these teachers and guidance counselors at their word — Asian students, year after year, were just a bit less personally appealing than white students and significantly less personally appealing than those who were black or Latino.

When Mortara and S.F.F.A.’s other attorneys asked Harvard admissions officers on the stand if they believed Asian applicants had less desirable traits than their white counterparts, they, of course, said no, they did not.

From a letter to The Harvard Crimson by a student named David A. Karnes, arguing against affirmative action for Asian-American applicants:

“Current U.S. Census figures show that Asian-Americans today penetrate all income levels and, in general, have attained an above-average standard of living. The barriers to equality which did indeed exist in the past for this group have largely vanished.”

And a rebuttal, a few weeks later, from a student named Charles D. Toy:

“Mr. Karnes adheres to the same misconception about Asian-Americans which has plagued them since intelligent people began to recognize and repudiate the savagery of official discrimination. Because he now perceives some ostensible penetration by Asian-Americans into various social and economic levels, Mr. Karnes concludes that most Asian-Americans no longer suffer the oppression of their status as a minority in this country.”

These two letters were published in the fall of 1976. Earlier that semester, Josephine M. Lok and Bet Har Wong, Asian-American freshmen roommates at Radcliffe, tried to attend an orientation banquet for minority students and found that they were not among the invitees. In a lengthy article about the beginning of the Asian-American student movement at Harvard published in March of this year in The Crimson, Lok said she didn’t really make a big deal of the omission because “we didn’t have that whole awareness.” But other Asian-American students on campus saw the incident as representative of their unseen, and largely unwelcome, presence there. This stood in direct contrast with federal law at the time; in 1977, for example, the Department of Labor designated minority groups as consisting of “negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.”

According to the article describing Wong and Lok’s strange rejection, after a group of Asian students confronted Fred Jewett, the dean of admissions, he told The Crimson in 1976 that Harvard did not count Asians as minorities because their enrollment numbers exceeded their share of the general American population. The demographics of the Harvard applicant pool, in other words, overruled everything else, whether common sense or the lived realities of many of the Asian students who attended Harvard.

“The case has been divisive, but it’s brought to light a lot of important issues like meritocracy and the model-minority myth. And for a lot of Asians, I think it’s opened up their eyes about how to possibly connect with other minority groups.”
These deliberations over race and privilege did not take place in a vacuum. In 1975, just a year before Wong and Lok were turned away from the minority-students banquet, Allan Bakke, a 35-year-old white man, was rejected for the second time by the medical school at the University of California, Davis. At the time, under a transparent affirmative-action policy, the school had reserved 16 of each class’s 100 spots for a “special admissions” program that considered the applications of “economically and/or educationally disadvantaged” students. Those applicants deemed disadvantaged were evaluated by a separate committee with different standards. After Bakke sued U.C. Davis, a California court ruled that the school’s program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits racial discrimination. In 1978, the Supreme Court agreed that Bakke had been discriminated against.

In the court’s decision in Bakke, Justice Lewis F. Powell cited Harvard’s admissions plan as the paragon of how diversity could be pursued in college admissions — because the school acknowledged, he wrote, that “a farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer.” The Bakke ruling meant that explicit quotas were unconstitutional, but when confronted with two equally qualified students, a school could give a “tip” to the one who could bring his or her unique regional or racial flavor to the college’s melting pot.

The spiritual language of affirmative action — to remedy the nation’s sins and to help underprivileged minorities who had been the victims of generational oppression — fell out of the legal conversation around affirmative action, mostly because any talk of “giving a leg up” to a certain number of students sounded too much like a quota system. “Diversity” became the new justification for considering a student’s race. It was no longer about righting history’s wrongs or ending poverty. It was now about the “something” a student from a different background could “bring” to campus.

In 1988, William Bradford Reynolds, who was an assistant attorney general and chief of the civil rights division in the Reagan administration’s Justice Department, spoke at a symposium on Asian-American university admissions sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat. By this point, official complaints of discrimination had been filed by Asian-American students at several top universities. In 1984, after a lengthy internal review, Brown University concluded that Asian-American applicants had been “treated unfairly.” By the time Reynolds took the stage to give his remarks, the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education had begun investigating admissions at several schools, including Harvard and U.C.L.A.

Until Reynolds’s speech, the question of discrimination against Asian applicants had not been explicitly placed within the context of affirmative action, at least not by someone in such a prominent position. But he noted “substantial statistical evidence” that Asian-Americans faced “higher hurdles than academically less qualified candidates of other races,” and he added that “rejection of such applicants ironically appears to be driven by the universities’ ‘affirmative-action’ policies aimed at favoring other, preferred racial minorities.” In this formulation, Asian students were being pitted against other minority groups for scarce, precious opportunities."

Affirmative Action is an imperfect solution to a real problem. De jure segregation was only done away in the mid 1960s-early 1970s and even then there is still de facto segregation today. I don't think one generation removed is enough time to level the playing field of a century+ of discrimination. Saying we should have meritocracy only clearly ignores all the history that led to the formation of affirmative action.

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"Over the next two years, the rules of the racial zero-sum game of college admissions took shape. The solidarity movements that started at Harvard in the late ’70s were supplanted by an uneasy coalition of conservative white politicians, writers and attorneys and Asian-American legal activists. In 1990, according to a lengthy study by Dana Y. Takagi, a professor at U.C. Santa Cruz, the Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation into whether white applicants had been discriminated against at U.C. Berkeley. One of the original complainants was Arthur Hu, a Chinese-American software programmer who, using data made public by the school, had painstakingly charted the test scores and academic credentials of black, white and Asian applicants.

Thirty years after Reynolds’s speech, Students for Fair Admissions revisited the 1988 playbook and filed its lawsuit against Harvard, claiming that its admissions process had discriminated against Asian applicants. During that time, the Asian population in the United States has grown to more than 21 million in 2016 from roughly 3.5 million in 1980, and a relatively narrowly defined group that used to apply mostly to Chinese and Japanese immigrants has been expanded to include everyone from the Hmong people to Koreans to South Asians. Attempts to corral all these peoples into one monolithic identity have become increasingly harder to reconcile. Asians are found throughout the socioeconomic spectrum. If it’s a silly endeavor to quantify racial oppression, it’s also absurd to equate the experience of a Sikh kid in Wisconsin with that of a Korean-American kid in Los Angeles.

And yet, when it comes to college admissions at elite schools, the conversation seems stuck in the past. None of the underlying questions have changed since Wong and Lok were turned away from that freshman banquet. Are Asians actually minorities? And if diversity — whatever that means — is the goal of affirmative action, how many Asians does a school really want on campus?

I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that I found Alex somewhat annoying at first. If I had been an alumni interviewer tasked with rating Alex’s personality on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being a student who showed unusual intellectual curiosity, grit and effervescence and 6 being a mumbling 4chan troll who would be a nightmare for his roommates, I would have given Alex a solid 3.

In my early 20s, I taught high-school English, and like many teachers, I grew to see students as types that recur over and over again. Alex struck me as the sort who would turn in perfectly competent papers about the assigned book, whether by Hawthorne or Ellison or Salinger, but wouldn’t engage with the text on an emotional level, at least not in the “Dangerous Minds” way that most young teachers want to see. And so I saw in Alex the stereotype of the Asian grade-grubbing machine. His résumé seemed filled with dubious positions: Really, what is the vice president of technology for a National Honor Society chapter?

I don’t say any of this to excuse myself or even say something as banal as “sometimes stereotypes are real.” I would just like to clear the air before we go on much more about Alex Chen, affirmative action and the broken way we talk about race and privilege in this country. The act of reporting on your “own people,” especially for prestigious outlets, requires a certain arrogance and presumption — that because you look like your subject, your perspective carries some revelatory power that might escape a standard, white journalist. I used to believe this was true, but I am no longer so certain.

Like Alex, I am a first-generation Asian-American with two college-educated parents. Unlike Alex, I grew up in majority-white, upper-middle-class college towns that exposed me to all the pathways to success that lay outside pure academic achievement. I spent my early childhood in a graduate-student housing complex just a few blocks from Harvard’s campus, where my father was getting his post-doctorate degree in organic chemistry. My mother made ends meet by babysitting for the children of professors. (In my early 20s, I ended up at the Columbia M.F.A. creative-writing program with the sister of one of these children. Her father was a famous physicist who wrote best-selling novels, and although I never brought up the fact that my mother had changed her sister’s diapers, I’ve thought a lot about how quickly the gap in our backgrounds had been erased.) By the time I graduated from a very good public high school in North Carolina, I could rattle off almost all the other very good high schools across the country, whether St. Mark’s, Isidore Newman, Montgomery Bell Academy, Thomas Jefferson Academy, Harvard-Westlake, Lexington High School or New Trier. By the time I was in my 30s, in a professional world stocked with Ivy Leaguers, I realized that everyone I knew from the D.C. area went to Sidwell Friends or Georgetown Day or Potomac, and everyone I know from Los Angeles went to Harvard-Westlake. Perhaps such distinctions seem trivial in the face of every other type of privilege, but within the context of one Harvard alumnus or alumna interviewing a prospective one, these references can lay out the common ground. What might seem like grade-grubbing ambition in a foreign context gets humanized within familiar spaces.
During that first meeting, I asked Alex if he had ever considered applying for a scholarship at any of New York City’s elite private schools, like Horace Mann, Collegiate or Dalton.

“What are those?” he asked. “Are those schools in the city?”

Which is all to say, if we’re going to see how Alex Chen, who would receive roughly the same credits and debits from affirmative action as I would, measures up, we should at least give an honest accounting of his past.

So here are some more relevant facts: Alex’s father, Qiao, immigrated to the United States in 1994, when he was 21. He grew up in poverty in the countryside of Fujian Province. He describes his hometown as a thoroughly corrupt place where people like him could not get anything done without bribing a local official. When Qiao was 18, his father moved to Flushing, Queens, where he found construction work and began saving up money. Qiao came three years later, after his father secured a green card, and worked in restaurants around Queens and Long Island. He spoke no English, but he enrolled in Queens College, which had an E.S.L. program for international students.

In 2000, Qiao brought his wife, Su, to the United States, and she moved into the basement apartment Qiao shared with his father in Flushing. Qiao saw life in America pragmatically — he acknowledges that he faced discrimination — and it was hard to go anywhere outside Chinese-speaking enclaves. He felt that his classmates at Queens College treated him like a low-rent immigrant. “The bad part,” he said, “was that I didn’t know the language, so I didn’t feel like I could fight back.” But those humiliations paled in comparison to life under corruption in China. “Everything was open in America,” Qiao said. “If I had the right paperwork for something or if I finished the work I was supposed to do, the right thing would get done. At least I could trust that.”

Qiao eventually found weekend work selling computer parts until he settled into a stable job as a technician. Su, who gave birth to Alex a few years after arriving in Flushing, struggled with life in the United States. She had been a middle-school teacher in China, but now she bounced between car dealerships, restaurants and, finally, an ice-cream parlor.

Alex was a bright and self-motivated student, someone whom Su “never had to worry about.” In the eighth grade, he came home and asked his parents if he could take the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT), the multiple-choice examination that determines entry into the city’s top public high schools. Su and Qiao were not planning on pressing Alex to take the SHSAT. And he did not enroll in an intensive prep course. “We are not tiger parents,” Su said. “Alex cares so much about his schoolwork, and we just supported him. But really, we did not know too much about any of this, and so he figured it out himself.”

Alex got into Bronx Science, widely considered the second-best of New York City’s three original specialized high schools. Qiao and Su, eager to help their son, but like so many immigrants hampered by the barriers of language and an unfamiliarity with the American school system, joined a group on the Chinese social-media service WeChat in which Chinese parents at Bronx Science talked about their children’s homework and their concerns about the school."

It's offensive because other groups are attempting to strip Asians of their identity as minorities in this country - who gives someone the right to do that?

Nor is it right to use an ""Uncle Tom""-like slur simply because of someone's position on an issue like AA. I can be supportive of efforts against police brutality, voter suppression, and lack of basic rights without supporting affirmative action. More broadly, I can recognize and condemn systemic racism without feeling personal guilt over injustices that weren't committed by my ancestors."

Using Asian Americans to fight affirmative action is pretty much a ploy to attack minorities.  Even the case against Harvard is brought about by conservative anti AA activists who guess what are not Asian Americans.

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"In the summer of 2018, the parents in the WeChat group began talking about proposed changes to the admissions criteria at the city’s specialized schools. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza, his schools chancellor, had proposed a new system that would phase out the SHSAT over two years and replace it with a University of Texas-style admissions program that would award seats to top students at all of the city’s middle schools. These changes would result in a radical shift in the racial demographics of the specialized high schools. At Stuyvesant, regarded as the most prestigious of the three specialized high schools, black and Hispanic students made up roughly 14 percent of the student population in 1976; Asians accounted for 16 percent. By 2017, black and Hispanic students had dropped to just 4 percent; Asians, by contrast, were now 74 percent of the student body. By spreading out admissions to the entirety of the city’s middle schools, many of which are overwhelmingly black and Latino, enrollment of underrepresented minorities was projected to go from its current 10 percent to nearly 50 percent. After presenting the plan, Carranza said, “I just don’t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admissions to these schools,” a clear reference to Asian-American students and their parents.

Qiao and Su’s WeChat group quickly turned into a political organizing platform. Participants began reaching out to other groups, including ones that supported the affirmative-action lawsuit against Harvard. The Chinese-language news broadcasts they watched every night provided blanket coverage of the SHSAT issue. “Many of our friends work in restaurants and are very poor,” Su said. “They don’t know anything about how to make their kids successful except SHSAT and then study hard to go to an Ivy League school. They feel like if you take that away, you are taking away their hope, because they don’t speak English well and have a hard time understanding how else to succeed in this country.” In mid-June, Qiao attended his first protest, which reconnected him with other parents who hadn’t found the same route to the middle class.
This past February, a workshop on the subject of race was offered to middle-school parents; it was run by the Center for Racial Justice in Education, a training organization. When Ingrid Flinn, a white mother of an adopted Asian child, questioned a white, male presenter from the center about the dearth of attention given to Asian-Americans in his presentation, he said that Asians benefited from white supremacy because of their proximity to white privilege. (The center denies that its workshop said Asians benefited from white supremacy.) The implication, Flinn felt, was that there was little need to talk about Asians. Yet they make up about 16 percent of students in the New York City public-school system, and by every measure, they suffer the highest poverty rates of any ethnic or racial group in the five boroughs.

I thought back to a morning when I met Alex in Van Cortlandt Park, a stretch of groomed pasture just about a 20-minute walk from Bronx Science. He and his cross-country teammates were meeting for their first practice of the year: South Asians, two girls wearing head coverings and full-length athletic wear as well as a handful of half-Asian kids. As they stretched, they joked about being out of shape and complained about the 1 train service up to the Bronx. According to the racial-privilege hierarchy of the New York City public schools, all those kids, with all their different backgrounds, skin tones and countries of origin, are the same as Alex. None of them warrant a mention in discussions of racial hierarchies.“I think it’s larger than Harvard. The real question is: Do we want to live in a society where character or skin color is the driving force for our discussions about merit? In singling out Asian-Americans for exclusion, Harvard panders to the worst stereotypes about us: that we are math geniuses with no personality.”
The Rally for the American Dream kicked off in Boston’s Copley Square on the eve of the trial. The organizers had promised “thousands” of demonstrators who would be rallying in favor of S.F.F.A.’s lawsuit. This optimistic projection (only a few hundred showed up) had been made by Yukong Zhao, a 56-year-old Chinese immigrant from Orlando who is the president of the Asian-American Coalition for Education and the author of the 2013 book “The Chinese Secrets for Success: Five Inspiring Confucian Values.” (The values: “Determination for an Outstanding Life,” “Pursuing an Excellent Education,” “Saving for a Better Life,” “Caring for Your Family” and “Developing Desirable Friendships.”) Zhao walks with a bit of a stoop, but he exudes an optimistic, cheerful energy when talking about America and its promise.

Zhao had always been involved in politics, but ever since he immigrated to the United States in 1992 to go to graduate school in urban studies and get an M.B.A., he has mostly expressed his opinions through writing. In one piece he wrote for The Orlando Sentinel, titled “Immigrants Can Add Valuable Ingredients to Melting Pot,” Zhao posed this question: “Why do so many immigrants prosper in America? Because we have suffered many life challenges from where we started to become Americans, we have valuable experiences we can share with struggling families, our spirit to overcome challenges, and our great cultural heritage on education and money management.”

Zhao, who became an American citizen in 2009, began his transition from writer to activist in October 2013, when Jimmy Kimmel put together a round table of young children for his late-night show and asked them what the United States should do about its $1.3 trillion debt to China. One suggestion, from a floppy-haired blond kid in a blazer and tie, was “kill everyone in China.” The joke sparked the expected online outrage among Chinese-American advocacy groups. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of several American cities to call for Kimmel’s firing. Kimmel quickly apologized, and ABC pulled the segment from its archives and YouTube.

Fresh off what these activists saw as a victory against the Kimmel show, the nascent movement turned its attention to Senate Constitutional Amendment 5 (SCA-5), a proposal in the California State Legislature that would have significantly scaled back Proposition 209, the 1996 ballot initiative that effectively ended affirmative action in California state universities. They followed up with civil rights complaints, including one that involved Zhao’s son. An informal partnership with Edward Blum soon followed.

Zhao has a complicated relationship with Blum. He says he appreciates all Blum has done for the cause, but he resists what he sees as the white-savior narrative. Asians, without any help from white people, had been challenging elite colleges since the 1980s. He understood that Blum’s money and connections might go further with the press and even the courts, but he saw this latest lawsuit and S.F.F.A. as a natural outgrowth of his grass-roots movement. “Asian-Americans filed all the complaints and stopped SCA-5,” he said. “This is not about conservatives or Republicans. We are not their tools. We are fighting for our children.”

I met Zhao at his hotel overlooking the Charles River on the morning of the Rally for the American Dream. He hadn’t been sleeping well, and his left eye had exploded into a deep, concerning shade of red. He asked if I wanted to hear him practice his speech — there were some passages where the English might need a little help. Zhao paced between the two queen beds and ran through his speech in his thick accent but practiced delivery. It was long and filled with purple phrases about freedom, fairness and the American dream. I could sense the hours he had spent on the speech, fine-tuning every phrase and making sure he gave proper credit to everyone who had put together the rally. On his first run-through, he asked me if it was “IN-actment” or “EN-actment,” and then a few moments later, was it “unethic” or “unethical”? Toward the end, I told him he had wrongly said “risen up” rather than “rising up.”

He asked if he should lose the kicker: “God bless America. And God bless Asian-American children.” I told him that I thought it would be a bit off to end with a phrase that made it seem as if Asian-American children needed a separate blessing from God. He puzzled over it for a bit, his glasses pushed far down on his nose, and ultimately agreed. As we crossed over a bridge into Boston, Zhao said, “Jay, I am frustrated with my pronunciation. If I had better pronunciation, I could make a much bigger impact on American society. I can work on everything else — ideas and writing — but the pronunciation is so hard to improve.”"

I had a friend who was dating a viet, they’re black, the viet’s family found out and threatened to cut off paying their college tuition if they continued a relationship with a black person. Multiple friends have had this issue and most of the times asian  families are fine with interracial dating if the other person is white, but if they’re not.:. It fucks me up when a friend says next time they date out, not gonna be asian because of how badly an asian family treated them. 

That’s why we’re viewed as white adjacent, parts of our community are very hostile to blacks and Latinos while not being the same towards whites. Is not cause we’re “looking for ourselves”.

01panm,,"Legacy admissions are already unpopular with the public - less than 10% of Americans think legacy should have play a major role in undergrad admissions. But that's just not going to move the needle with Harvard, given that legacies drive their billions of endowment. 

Look, I agree that legacy admission is unmeritocratic and hurts Asians and other minorities. I also agree that groups like SFFA are using Asians as a tool for their own agenda. But, as an Asian, I also know that people like me will have an easier time getting into elite universities without the current iteration of affirmative action. I don't see why I shouldn't look out for my own self-interest, especially given that I don't see any evidence of people on either side of the debate doing so.

And I'll believe that a serious legal challenge exists when I see it. The last time anyone on the Supreme Court addressed it was Thomas (who is neither a legacy nor supportive of legacy admissions):

>	The Equal Protection Clause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissions procedures. What the Equal Protection Clause does prohibit are classifications made on the basis of race. So while legacy preferences can stand under the Constitution, racial discrimination cannot."

We can pressure politicians because they need our votes to stay in office. We can pressure Facebook for being complicit in election meddling and misinformation because they need us as users to stay relevant.

Harvard's power isn't a product of their popularity with the everyday person. Their power is in being a part of the entrenched elite - putting their people in the government, finance, law, etc. The 1% have been so unpopular for so long but that hasn't resulted in any meaningful change."

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"I did not agree with much of Zhao’s speech, but I felt a connection with him, unexpected but undeniable. How many times had my own parents asked for help with emails or letters to school? And how had their limitations and perpetual foreignness affected their ability to stand up for themselves? Zhao kept telling me that he was fighting for me and my young daughter. It was hard to know what to make of this declaration, but I never doubted that he believed it. Whenever he hears talk about relative privilege or white supremacy or all the advantages Asians have over other minorities, he considers his own childhood under the Cultural Revolution, his own path to the United States and his struggles with learning the language, and fails to see why the spoils of that work, which include a big house in a gated community, couldn’t be achieved by anyone else.

This need to be seen — to have the struggles of Asian-Americans and the discrimination they faced be recognized — was echoed by Mortara in his closing statement for the S.F.F.A. lawsuit. “Someday this will be written about in the history books, and those books will say: There was Asian discrimination at Harvard,” Mortara said in court. Choking back tears, he said, “Of that I’m confident.” And while I might have been surprised by the outpouring of emotion and skeptical of his methods, I did not doubt Mortara’s sincerity either.

During the time I spent talking to Asian-American students about affirmative action, I noticed that many of them wanted to talk, instead, about their immigrant parents. For them, the issue was relatively simple. “The way they see it, they came to this country with nothing and went through a lot of discrimination,” a student at an elite, high-profile public high school in New York told me. “They don’t understand why the system says they have an advantage over anyone else. I disagree with them on a lot of it, but I understand why they feel that way.”

For many of these parents, the Harvard case, with its revelations about personal ratings, as well as what many of the parents in New York see as the erasure from the city’s Department of Education, has created a binary choice. They can choose the side that is trying to get more of their children into Harvard and other elite schools, or they can choose the side that will not even bother mentioning them. Qiao Chen, despite the protestations of his son, voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Although he now regrets the choice, he told me that he did it because liberals do not care about Asian-Americans.“Race-conscious admissions for me meant acknowledging the full human dignity of my story and my achievements in context. I will never forget the diversity of perspectives and experiences that my peers bravely shared on campus and in this trial, all of which are incredible assets in this multiracial world we willgo on to work and live in. Regardless of how this case isdecided, the educational landscape is much bigger thanjust Harvard — I hope that as a society we look toward increasing educational opportunities that are accessible for all.”
“Sparse country” is the term Harvard uses to describe the geographic areas of the United States that are underrepresented in the student body. This includes the usual suspects — Wyoming, Alaska, Montana — but also states with large metropolitan areas like Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma. To geographically diversify its incoming freshman class, Harvard gives a bump to promising students from sparse country. It also recruits heavily to ensure that the top students in Arizona and Alabama and Maine consider coming to Harvard over their local state colleges and universities. Recruitment certainly does not equal admission, but Harvard starts to shape its incoming class through these early encounters and follows up diligently and often through email, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.

This process begins with sophomores and juniors who take the PSAT, and later the SAT. Harvard purchases scores from the College Board and mails invitations to apply to students with strong scores relative to their demographic group, whatever that might be. In sparse country, the admissions office extends an invitation to any white student who scores above 1,310 on the tests and any black student who scores above a 1,100. Male Asian students from the same places need to score a 1,380 on the tests to receive an invitation to apply. For female Asian students, the cutoff is 1,350.

For the past four decades, these types of decisions have been the purview of William R. Fitzsimmons, a graduate of the class of 1967 and Harvard College’s dean of admissions. Fitzsimmons, who goes by Fitz, grew up in his family’s gas station in Weymouth, a working-class suburb on Boston’s South Shore. In the parlance of his office, he was a “first-generation college student” from an “economically disadvantaged” background, as well as a star hockey goalie. Although he wasn’t an “economically disadvantaged” minority, he understands what it’s like to be different at the most elite educational institution in America.

Fitz, with his strong, square jaw, carefully measured Boston accent and tweed jackets, perfectly fills the role of the Harvard man. Over four days of testimony, he laid out his legacy — he came to the Harvard admissions office in 1972, took over a few years later and has been the dean since 1986. This presented something of a problem for the defense because every bit of mail, every spreadsheet, every memo or communiqué issued by the Harvard College admissions office since the Nixon administration reflected on Fitzsimmons’s office.

During a bizarre section of Fitzsimmons’s testimony in which he claimed a 1,100 on the PSAT was only “slightly lower” than a 1,380, an S.F.F.A. lawyer named John M. Hughes posed the following hypothetical: Let’s take two students at the same high school in Las Vegas. One white, the other Asian. The white student scores a 1,310. The Asian student receives a 1,370. According to Fitzsimmons’s testimony, the white student would be invited to apply to Harvard while the Asian student would not. How, the attorney asked, could Fitzsimmons begin to explain this?

In response, Fitzsimmons talked about his own days at Harvard and a roommate from Mitchell, S.D., home of the celebrated Corn Palace, and how he had been a “great ambassador” for his home state. “There are people who, let’s say, for example, have only lived in the sparse-country state for a year or two,” Fitzsimmons noted.

The implication, of course, was that an Asian applicant from Oklahoma or Nebraska or South Dakota or Alaska does not count when it comes to “geographic diversity.” In Harvard’s eyes, this Asian, even if his family settled in Nevada after helping build the transcontinental railroad, could never be an “ambassador” for his plot of “sparse country.” He was, instead, an Asian-American like other Asian-Americans. The white student’s family, by contrast, could have recently moved to Las Vegas to work in the emerging tech field, and he would still be assumed to be a fitting representative of the Silver State.

When Harvard went looking for a South Dakotan, did it just look for a white kid who grew up on a ranch and worked the concession stands at the Corn Palace? When it wanted an Oklahoman, was it really seeking out a cowboy who also liked high-school debate and biology? Harvard’s vision of diversity seemed stuck in a time before immigration and demographic change. During his cross-examination, Fitzsimmons was asked several times if the Harvard admissions process had changed at all in the 46 years he had worked in the admissions office. Fitzsimmons, every time, said the system had remained almost exactly the same.“The current practice of affirmative action is discriminatory and unfair to everyone. Education is a right, and the race of someone should not determine whether or not someone should get into school.”
On the third day of the trial, I had dinner with Sally Chen and her friend Thang Diep, both in Harvard’s graduating class of 2019, at a Japanese-barbecue restaurant in Harvard Square. Thang, a senior neurobiology major and one of the main voices testifying in support of Harvard at the trial, had been repeatedly misidentified in media reports about the trial as a “refugee.” This, he said, was “really annoying,” and he requested I not make the same mistake. Thang’s grandparents were the actual refugees — they were the ones who fled Vietnam and settled in Reseda, a middle-class suburb in Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley. When Thang was 8, he and his parents immigrated to join them in California. Thang spoke almost no English, but through a self-imposed regimen of assimilation, he worked his way into one of Southern California’s most prestigious magnet high schools.

People on Harvard’s side testified about Thang’s essay, emphasizing his divulgence that he placed a pencil between his teeth while practicing his pronunciation because he heard that was the quickest way to overcome the steep learning curve that separates a tonal language like Vietnamese from English. In comments, one of Harvard’s admissions readers wrote, “Essay- immigrant Vietnamese identity & pencils as tools.” And then, “Add’l- grappling with sexual identity.”

Thang was valedictorian of his high-school class, but he scored only a combined 1,360 on the verbal and math sections of the SAT, and his other standardized test scores weren’t much better. These results most likely would have put him outside the lower threshold for Harvard, which, as it said throughout the trial, turns away dozens of applicants with perfect scores every year."

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"Sally and Thang were the de facto counterexamples in the trial. Their smiling photos were shown on the courtroom television screens; their G.P.A.s and test scores were discussed, at length, by Fitzsimmons and the stream of pro-diversity speakers backing Harvard. Sally, who grew up in a low-income immigrant household in San Francisco, proved that highly motivated, poor Asian students would be admitted to Harvard. Thang, whose low SAT scores were put on parade throughout the trial, proved that Harvard actually did care about Asian struggle narratives. But Thang’s and Sally’s stories, which were pushed out to the media, existed almost as ornamentation to the actual trial. In fact, it wasn’t clear if Harvard or its experts knew much about Asians at all. On the second-to-last day of the trial, Mortara went through a litany of stereotypes about Asian applicants — one-dimensional, future doctors, children of mathematicians and engineers. He asked David Card, an economist testifying for Harvard as an expert witness, if he was aware that they were, indeed, stereotypes. Each time, Card said he wasn’t sure.

Both Sally and Thang seemed aware of their role in the trial. But they also don’t see the trial as a fight between concerned Asian parents and Harvard’s admissions office, but rather as the last defense of affirmative action against a man who had successfully undercut the Voting Rights Act and who seems hellbent on ending racial preferences everywhere. “I don’t really feel like I’m on the side of Harvard,” Sally said. “As someone who advocates against Harvard on many issues, it’s really hard to give Harvard this kind of power. So I think of it more as having a broad impact on the baseline for not just here but a lot of other places, like workplaces and other universities.”

Sally’s dilemma was shared by many of the alumni, students and faculty who showed up to the courthouse. It’s difficult to defend a vision of diversity that has had many of its clearest and most evocative claims of racial and economic justice stripped away by decades of court challenges, demographic change in the applicant pool and escalating hypercompetitiveness for a fixed number of seats. During the trial, the racial and social-justice reasoning — the spirit of affirmative action — was never really stated. What stood in its place, mostly because of the legal realities of “diversity,” which constrained what Harvard could defend in court, was the sense that students of color on campus needed to have others who looked like them. This justification exposed one of the puzzling contradictions at the heart of this case: By law, Harvard cannot have a quota system. But it also looks as if Harvard believes there is a set range of how many black, Latino and Asian students ought to be on campus. Roughly 30 percent of the seats in every Harvard class go to athletes, legacies, the children of faculty and applicants on the dean’s interest list, composed in large part of the children of donors. This group, called A.L.D.C.s, get into Harvard at a rate of about 45 percent, far greater than the 5 percent rate for the rest of the pool. Two percent of Asian applicants are A.L.D.C.s. The zero-sum view of this arrangement never asks why the spots for more Asian kids couldn’t come from the pool of A.L.D.C.s.

S.F.F.A.’s attorneys did not contest the defense of the benefits of diversity, as displayed in court. There was no need, really. They chose, instead, to pick out a few contradictions in Harvard’s practices that implicitly questioned whether the school’s actual practices measured up to its expressed, righteous defense.“Despite my strong support for diversity policies and race-conscious admissions, I in no way want to make it seem that Harvard’s admissions system or treatment of Asian-Americans is perfect. Harvard can and should do more to make sure that they fight against any implicit biases that may permeate the admissions system. But the solution to this issue is to not ignore the racial and financial barriers of access that continue to plague our country, or to reduce the nuance within an already limited application — it’s to pay more attention to race.”
In the months after the trial’s conclusion, I asked Harvard on numerous occasions to explain its admissions process. (I made several requests to interview Fitzsimmons as well. All of these were denied.) The stock answer, always delivered from the P.R. office, never deviated from what Harvard has consistently said: We have a complicated and in-depth process that involves dozens of people and hundreds of hours, and there’s no way to quantify it. You just have to trust it.

Some clarity, however dim, can be found in Plaintiff’s Exhibit 555 from the trial: “Ethnicity was only considered a ‘plus’ when the applicant wrote about or indicated the significance of his or her heritage, or when there was some other indicia in the file of the applicant’s involvement with ethnic community organizations or groups.”

This passage comes from the 1990 report on Harvard’s admissions practices filed by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education. In the 28 years since then, the personal essay has become an even larger part of how Harvard makes its race-conscious decisions, so much so that in a draft of instructions sent out last year, the admissions office specified that “the consideration of race or ethnicity should be in connection with the application’s discussion of the effect an applicant’s race or ethnicity has had on the applicant, not simply the fact alone.”

When Sally was applying to colleges, she says, her guidance counselor advised her to not write her essay about her identity, because “nobody wants to read another Asian immigrant story.” Sally ignored him and wrote about acting as a translator for her parents as they encountered the humiliations and hassles of working-class life.

Sally scored a 1,550 on the SAT. She was student-body president at Lowell and played violin in the school orchestra. But during the trial, Harvard’s attorneys intimated that she would not have gotten into Harvard without her personal qualities, calling her admission “a wonderful example of the consideration of an application by a group of people who ultimately came to the correct decision and admitted Ms. Chen. But it was only the result of an iterative and open process.” As proof, they pointed to her application, which included an interviewer’s report mentioning her ethnicity on two occasions:

“Categorized as low-income and with Taiwanese-speaking parents, she relates to the plight of the outsiders in Ralph Ellison and William Faulkner. ...”

And:

“Her claims about making friends across multiple social groups seem credible. As the youngest of 4 in a culturally Chinese home, she feels a responsibility to take care of her parents. Recommending a 1 specifically for Contribution because of her demonstrated energy and specific desire to connect socially with everybody. As the youngest of 4 in a small apartment, she has lots of experience with being a roommate in close quarters.”

It’s worth asking if a white student, who did not bear the stereotype of the shy Asian who only hangs out with other Asians, would need to “credibly” claim to want to make friends across “multiple social groups.” And while it’s difficult to read too much into such brief notes, Sally’s top personality score seemed to come from the fact that she broke the stereotype and wouldn’t just be quiet and self-segregated. If this is Harvard’s idea of “diversity,” it’s a white-down vision that rewards students for acting, in essence, more like wealthy white kids.

But the emphasis on the essay revealed a much more troubling standard. Harvard, in essence, is saying that if you want your race to count, you need to prove to us why it matters. Or perhaps, to be more precise, when you write an essay to present who you are to the most prestigious college in the country, you should reduce your life to a moment of trauma.

At dinner at the Japanese steakhouse, Thang seemed to understand all this. While quietly searing his steak on the tabletop grill, he said: “I don’t want to defend Harvard. But it’s the better of two evils.”
“Affirmative action is designed so that for every one person who benefits, someone else needs to lose. Unfortunately, those losing should not be another minority. I think that it is important for us to understand that maintaining diversity is a priority because it is necessary to have multiple cultures and backgrounds blend together for people to have a well-rounded education.”
In September 2017, Delmar Fears, a 19-year-old junior at Cornell, walked up to the office of President Martha E. Pollack. As co-chair of the group Black Students United, she was accompanied by hundreds of chanting students who had all come to deliver a set of demands. The list mostly included administrative and curricular changes, from the creation of a “minority-liaison-at-large” position to the hiring of psychologists and physicians of color. But the ninth demand, sandwiched between the creation of a “student honor board” and a “permanent presidential task force,” set off an unexpected maelstrom.

“We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students. While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism.”"

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"Fears and her group received weeks of blowback from conservative websites, and Black Students United later said it regretted the wording of its statement. But that year Fears wrote a final paper on the issue titled “Who Makes Up the 7 Percent of Black Cornellians?” which detailed some of the demographic change that had taken place on exclusive college campuses. In a 2004 New York Times article, Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of Harvard’s African and African-American studies department, and Lani Guinier, a professor in the law school, pointed out that while Harvard had increased its black undergraduate population to 8 percent, a majority of those students — up to two-thirds — were international students, first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean or the children of biracial couples. What was rare, Gates said, was the black student whose four grandparents lived through slavery, Reconstruction and Jim Crow. Mary C. Waters, the head of Harvard’s sociology department, told The Times, “You need a philosophical discussion about what are the aims of affirmative action. If it’s about getting black faces at Harvard, then you’re doing fine. If it’s about making up for 200 to 500 years of slavery in this country and its aftermath, then you’re not doing well.”
In 2007, Camille Z. Charles, a professor of sociology and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and three co-authors, Margarita Mooney, Douglas S. Massey and Kimberly C. Torres, published a study in The Journal of Education titled “Black Immigrants and Black Natives Attending Selective Colleges and Universities in the United States.” Charles, Mooney, Massey and Mary J. Fischer followed up that research with a 2009 article, “Affirmative Action Programs for Minority Students: Right in Theory, Wrong in Practice.” Both papers reported an “overrepresentation” of black immigrant students at highly selective colleges and universities compared with black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved.

Charles’s study drew on data from 28 schools, going back to 1999. Nearly 20 years later, she is confident that the proportion of black immigrants has increased, but she can’t say exactly how much, because schools do not make that information accessible to the public. “It’s a way to have some plausible deniability,” Charles told me. “The schools are purposefully not paying attention to the backgrounds of the black students they admit. In the ’80s and ’90s, low-income black students could talk about overcoming obstacles in their essays, but over time, that narrative has worn thin. But the immigrant narrative, which is also an American narrative, in some ways might have become a more appealing story for admissions officers. A student can write, say, ‘My parents were doctors in Nigeria, but they had to start all over in the United States,’ and that story doesn’t invoke white guilt. It doesn’t even tie to affirmative action in the same way, because there isn’t this assumption of lesser qualifications that still follows black American students, no matter their backgrounds or their parents’ backgrounds.” Charles continued: “I think there are American blacks whose families have suffered generationally who are being squeezed out.”

Charles, it should be said, did not undertake her study in order to pit one group of black people against another. And she emphasizes that she does not think affirmative-action spots should be taken away from black immigrants.

Edward Blum, Delmar Fears and Yukong Zhao may not agree on much of anything, but they all have made versions of an argument that the spirit of affirmative action has been replaced by a largely cosmetic, overly simplified diversity that allows elite institutions to report gains in black and Latino student populations without having to engage in the harder work of undoing systemic inequality. Waters’s question from 2004 has largely gone unaddressed: If you stop random supporters of affirmative action on the street and ask why they believe in it, they will most likely discuss the need to address the harms of historic, institutional racism. They may talk abstractly about a poor, “inner city” or “urban” kid in, say, Detroit and how his test scores, grades and accomplishments should be evaluated in the context of the extraordinary inequality within this country.

The truth at Harvard and other elite private colleges is that the supposed zero-sum game of admissions slots isn’t really between Asian immigrants and the descendants of enslaved people, but rather between Asian immigrants, Latino immigrants and black immigrants. Some inevitable, deeply uncomfortable questions arise: If you compare an Asian-American student raised in poverty by parents who fled Vietnam during the fall of Saigon with the son of Chilean doctors who come from generational wealth and sent their child to 12 years of private school, who is more privileged? If you accept that the child of, say, solidly middle-class Ghanaian immigrants has to deal with racism in the work force, profiling by the police and all the harms of systemic inequality while the same working-class Asian kid gets to slide into whiteness, how much advantage do you give to ameliorate the disadvantage between one immigrant and another? What if you replace the working-class Vietnamese student with the daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants, who, among other things, has had to deal with the profiling of Muslim communities and Trump’s travel ban? These are not outlier examples used in bad faith to present a provocative but false choice. At Harvard and other elite schools, the outlier example is the “inner city” kid from Detroit.

These bizarre, discomforting litigations of race and privilege make sense only within the context of the most exclusive places in America. But if Harvard loses in the Supreme Court, Blum will be closer to his goal of eliminating racial preferences, not only in college admissions but also in every other corner of federal law. Even if Blum eventually loses this case, it’s hard to imagine that he will stop. In 2014, S.F.F.A. filed another discrimination lawsuit, against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The U.N.C. case, which has yet to go to trial, is not about Asian-American applicants, but the goal is the same: end affirmative action everywhere.

On March 12 of this year, a group of federal prosecutors in the same Boston building as Judge Burroughs’s courtroom unsealed the indictments in Operation Varsity Blues, the nationwide college-admissions bribery case that set off a monthslong media circus involving everyone from the actress Felicity Huffman to the head coach of Yale’s women’s soccer team. Legally speaking, Varsity Blues has nothing to do with S.F.F.A. v. Harvard, but the scandal recast the affirmative-action debate in a bit of a humiliating yet ultimately necessary context: It felt as if a bunch of minorities were clawing at one another while a line of entitled, less qualified white kids walked through the gates of Ivy League schools as their alumni parents unpacked an S.U.V. filled with weird rackets and skis.
A few weeks later, I met Alex again at a bubble-tea shop in Flushing. Congratulations were in order — after a somewhat rocky admissions process in which he had applied early to Yale and been deferred, was accepted to Binghamton, Rochester and Rice but rejected at Brown, Princeton and Stanford and was wait-listed at Vanderbilt, Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Duke, Alex had received some good news. He had been accepted at Yale, his dream school.

“How’s it feel?” I asked.

“I mean, I’m excited,” he said.

“Did you expect to get in?”

“Of course not! I mean, it’s Yale. ...”

“Were you upset that you didn’t get into some of those other schools?” I asked.

“No, why would I be upset?”

“Like Brown. ... Don’t you think you were qualified to go to Brown?”

“Well, I don’t think I really fit the type of super intellectually curious student that Brown says they’re looking for,” he said. “I mean, it’s not that I’m not intellectually curious — I am — but they seem to want people who don’t really know what they want to do yet and think the entire world is fascinating. I’m a bit more focused than that.”

He said his opinion of affirmative action had evolved. “My thinking has really changed,” he said, noting that his government class had discussed affirmative action and how it connected to white supremacy. He still thought it was “wrong to have a system where some people’s work was less valued than others,” but he said he appreciated why it might be necessary to adjust for differences in background.

My understanding of him had changed, too. Despite all his résumé building and the involvement in random clubs and his own admitting that some of that effort had been so much padding, I could see that his was an inquisitive mind, and he wanted more than simply to disprove the trope of the cynical Asian grade-grubber. His core interests lay in the sociological data projects he had done at N.Y.U. and then at the offices of Assemblywoman Niou. I asked if he had written about his data work for his essay. He said he had mentioned it, but that he had mostly written about being the child of immigrants.

“Didn’t you know you weren’t supposed to write about that?” I asked, thinking of Sally Chen’s guidance counselor.

“What?” he asked.

“I think they’re tired of hearing the immigrant story, especially from East Asian kids of college-educated parents,” I said.

“What!” he said again, with what sounded like genuine disbelief. He stirred his bubble tea with a straw and laughed a bit sheepishly. “I wish someone had told me.”"

Admiral_Wen,,"This article pretty much echos my sentiment on this issue perfectly. Thanks for posting it.

I've always struggled a bit when thinking about the higher education issues today. On the one hand, I absolutely agree that diversity is important in education. It's imperative that young adults have the opportunity to be exposed to perspectives different from their own. I also don't believe that numerical scores should be the sole criteria for admissions. Asian Americans possess this diverse array of talents too, and we should be eager to showcase this. Not to mention, the image of robotic test takers is already quite prevalent and *extremely* damaging, so to argue against holistic admissions only reinforces this stereotype in the eyes of our peers, admissions officers, and eventually HR managers.

But on the other hand, I can't help but to feel that these ""holistic"" processes are ever so subtly biased. ""Holistic"" will always be presented as warm and desirable, but behind closed doors it also gives schools much more room to skew the results. Why did Asian applicants score lower on personality? Harvard's personality score supposedly comes from the student's essays, recommendations, and alumni interviews. I sincerely doubt that Asian students would be performing worse here. Plus, do we really accept that we are, as Harvard puts it, lacking in courage, kindness, and likability? Isn't this precisely the kind of racial prejudice that we today should be aiming to eliminate? The holistic process is supposed to be a path for students to demonstrate their potential, instead it seems to be a mechanism to conceal racial undertones, even if subconsciously. And I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way.

The way to proceed, I believe, is to scrutinize the use of admissions criteria such as personality. It shouldn't be up to the admissions officers anyway to decide who's more likable or courageous, as these are completely subjective and impossible to determine from a college application. We should not seek to eliminate affirmative action, as diversity does serve an important purpose. And even if we're not a part of the African American or Latino communities, we still owe it to each other to be genuinely considerate. Not to mention, fighting against race-based admissions will always be a losing battle, since even if people agree there won't be much sympathy given how Asian Americans are already overrepresented in top schools. And of course, we absolutely cannot allow ourselves to be used as pawns in this arena anymore. Pretty much every notable lawsuit in the past decade against higher education, including this current one, has been led by conservative white activists, dragging us into their fight at their convenience. This cannot continue.

We are not known for being confrontational, but of all the political issues this one might be the one that ignites us the most. No matter where you stand, I urge you to stand up and make your voice heard."
dasheea,,"This is massively missing the fact that holistic admissions was first used to exclude Jewish students.  There was already a precedent set there.  That is one of the reasons why the claim that it is now used to suppress AA admissions is quite believable.  Holistic admissions can theoretically be used in a genuine race-blind way (if your goal really is race-blind admissions), but it can absolutely (and obviously) be ""weaponized"" to just make admissions as subjective and biased as possible to create whatever student body you want to.  

The issue is simply whether or not you can gather and collect evidence that the process was racially biased.  While holistic admissions makes the acceptance policy more subjective, it obviously also leaves a vague ""subjective"" paper trail as well, making gathering evidence not that simple.  

Strictly speaking, yes, it's true that the concept of affirmative action and the concept of racial bias against AAs need not overlap.  So the author wants to say ""Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and would rather cure what's wrong with the bathwater (fix racial bias against AAs, don't get rid of affirmative action).  

>Even if Harvard admissions officers were biased against Asian Americans, the solution would not lie in abandoning holistic admissions and affirmative action,

But we actually have to step back first and realize that affirmative action and holistic admissions should not be conflated!  And the fact that the author does conflate them to me is a problem.  It feels like the author is just one of many out there who has a casual understanding of the problem and isn't really qualified to make a proper journalistic or expert opinion on this (not that I can, either, but I'm just a random Redditor).  Holistic admissions is the concept of evaluating an individual on all their stuff - extracurriculars, socioeconomic background, etc., etc.  Affirmative action is the concept of explicitly giving an advantage to minorities in admissions.  You can theoretically have holistic admissions that is race-blind (~~what the author hopes for~~ - thank you to /u/InSearchOfGoodPun for correcting me.  The author wants affirmative action.) and so has no affirmative action, and you can also theoretically have affirmative action without using holistic admissions (e.g. an admissions system that uses only exams but there are quotas for admissions/cutoff scores for geographical areas or ethnicities.  I believe China does this with the gaokao with different cutoff scores for provinces and ethnic minorities).  

IMHO, the ""philosophical"" arguments for dismantling affirmative action are: 

1. The same as the argument for test papers to be graded to not have the test taker's name written on them - only an ID number.  The names and IDs can be matched by another teacher/official.  This way, you minimize the possibility that the grader of a test paper will be biased against the test taker.  In other words, if resumes with black American-sounding names get disproportionately low callbacks from hiring employers, a radical solution is for resumes to not have names on them, only ID numbers.  The names can be matched with names later in the process (even if racial bias may be an issue later in the process, at least in the callback stage it will be minimized).  By the way, this is similar to why AAs disproportionately go into STEM, as the author duly notes - it's to shield oneself from subjective discrimination/exclusion.

2. The real enemy of AAs is ""weaponized"" holistic admissions (and not affirmative action per se), but the problem is that holistic admissions and affirmative action go hand-in-hand for whatever reason in the US and there are, understandably, defenders of affirmative action.  (One reason that holistic admissions and affirmative action go hand-in-hand is an aversion to official quotas.  If in a parallel world we all just accepted that colleges officially quota their student racial compositions using affirmative action standards, we could just go with that and drop holistic admissions.  Ethnic minorities might not mind that much because a) as long as your own minority gets some sort of overrepresentation thanks to the policy, you might be happy, b) if you don't feel like your minority is getting the proper representation, at least there's some objective data you can point to and fight against, and c) ethnic minorities are used to feeling quota'd, anyway.  The difference between an official and an unofficial quota is minor to an ethnic minority applying for admissions.  It's only major for the admissions officers and policy makers because an official quota may invite accusations of inequality and stuff.  (It might also be technically illegal to quota admissions?))  It's unlikely that U.S. colleges will drop holistic admissions while keeping affirmative action by using quotas or different cutoff evaluations for different races/ethnicities.  Even setting aside affirmative action, it's unlikely that U.S. colleges will drop holistic admissions at all, since holistic admissions gives colleges control over the makeup of their student bodies - even a truly ideal race-blind college may still want control over the makeup of their student body (e.g. a diversity or focus of extracurricular interests and academic majors).  So in this view, if holistic admissions cannot be done away with on its own or its racial bias against AAs cannot be fixed, the other solution is to do away with affirmative action.  In the AA view, even if that hurts non-AA minority admissions (and helps white American admissions), at least it will do away with this specific unofficial racial disadvantage that AA applicants have.  

Going to another topic: 

> The “model minority” stereotype portrays Asian Americans as having “made it”: They worked hard and persevered and achieved the American dream.

>Data reveals a much more complicated picture, but the framing of Asian Americans as successful was never about accuracy: It was about driving a wedge between members of different ethnic groups and undermining the claims of systemic racism made by civil rights activists. (If they can make it, why can’t you?)

Is this really true from the AA perspective?  I understand that it's true for non-AA minorities, but from the AA perspective, or rather the East Asian American perspective, I think model minority = a manifestation of putting your head down and working hard and avoiding putting your fate in the hands of people you can't trust to be racially unbiased (i.e. going into STEM, avoiding politics and conflict).  I'm not saying that there aren't people who use the model minority thing to attack non-AA minorities, because there certainly are, but I would say that EAAs don't see the model minority thing as first and foremost about that.  To me, the EAA perspective is, ""We don't care what you call us, model or unmodel minority or whatever.  Our priority is to survive and advance in the optimal way we can see.""  What I'm trying to say I guess is that there are two aspects to the model minority thing.  One is when it's used to attack non-AAs.  The other is a manifestation of this:

>While interviewing Asian-American students in colleges across the country, we have heard students report that their parents push them into STEM because they assume that people in STEM fields will be judged more “objectively” than in other fields and careers; racial bias will be less of a factor. Colleges and universities need to understand that Asian Americans do encounter racism and that their seemingly stereotypical behavior may be a response to this. 

which might exist even in a world where non-AAs aren't attacked by the model minority argument."

We always complain about other PoC not backing us and maybe aligning ourselves with these issues is why, they see us came out to try to get peter liang off the hook when he shot a black dude. Like our main issues with America seems to be “it’s unfair we’re not being treated like whites”. Like we were mad liang wasn’t gonna get off like a white cop would have and that makes him a scapegoat. It does, he still did that shit. We’re mad Harvard isn’t treating us the way it should because we bought into the idea of American meritocracy, “we worked harder than other minorities why should they take our spot.”

2. I think you can fight hollistic admissions without coming after AA. Holistic admissions is clearly white people judging minorities based on standards of white guy likability. Asians not being “courageous or widely respected” just means we don’t have white guy/lady HR energy "

sad_pizza,,"I think the use of race as a factor for admission is intended to be separate from the use of personal ratings in evaluating applicants. 

But in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. For example, if we have an Asian student who is a strong academic performer with great extracurricular activities, sports, etc. and another student of a different race who is not as strong in these areas. But I'm Harvard, and I've already accepted the roughly 20% of the Asians I need for the incoming class. I'm not going to openly say that I accepted the second student because he or she was of x/y/z race. That would be terrible, optically. No, I'm going to say that the second candidate had other qualitative attributes that put them over the top. And by doing so, Harvard is implicitly saying the the Asian candidate was just not as personable or likeable. And that is what many take offense to.

And on your second point, I think the debate about Vox being pretty openly ""unfriendly"" to Asian Americans has been long over. Sometimes I feel like I'm a black person watching Fox News right as they are about to bring on a black guest to lecture me on why I'm so terrible."

The whole concept of ""popularity"" needs to be done away with and this is where I believe the bias against AA comes into play. The idea that it's the 21st century and we are talking about popularity as a factor of admission is insane. Admission into a school should not be a popularity contest. As an admissions officer, you should be focused on whether or not someone will be a productive member of society (both socially and economically) after leaving your institution AND NOT whether or not you want to fuck the applicant.

With everything said, Harvard should actually use the personal rating as intended rather than as a proxy for race. And if you want to argue that they are not doing that, I think you're going to have a difficult time seeing as the racial make up of the student body has been rather consistent over the past couple of decades. But hey, it could be the coincidence of the century!

No one is saying Vox = Fox News. What I am saying is that some of the tactics employed are eerily similar. Like, why have an Asian American author write this piece?

You can see my confusion.

It doesn't matter whether the issue is clear-cut or not.  There is no black writer on Vox that has written anything remotely close to anti-black activism the way their Asian writers do.  If you find any black author on Vox in the same solar system as Alvin Chang - perpetuating offensive racial stereotypes, calling blacks racist for standing up for themselves, aggressively undermining black activism - I will happily concede my point and declare you correct.

Until then, my point stands: to the shock of absolutely no one, Vox is not an objective source here.  In particular their AA articles have a history of being aggressively offensive towards Asians.

everythingbuttheguac,,"From an advocacy perspective, there's not much to be done. The law already says (and has said for a long time) that it's not constitutional to have a racial preference for whites over Asians.

Being able to prove it is a whole separate issue and gets messy. [This very issue was covered in depth in the Harvard lawsuit](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/3/admissions-decision-explained/), but it was SFFA (who want to make affirmative action illegal) that claimed Harvard has a racial preference for whites over Asians, while Harvard (and defenders of affirmative action) claimed that there was such no racial preference. For those who support affirmative action but believe that Harvard is discriminating against asians, it's a tough spot to be in.

It's also important to note how narrow this protection actually is. It's unconstitutional to have preferences based on race but constitutional to have preferences highly correlated with being rich and white, such as legacy status, donor status or athlete status ([this is a great article]( https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/harvard-university-and-scandal-sports-recruitment/599248/#%3A~%3Atext%3DNearly%2090%20percent%20of%20recruited%2Cpercent%20of%20its%20admitted%20class.) on how Ivy athletics are another way for wealthy families to get their kids into these schools). 

In other words, Harvard cannot prefer a middle-class white applicant over an equally qualified Asian applicant, but can absolutely prefer a legacy, donor or athlete applicant (who are much more likely to be rich and white) over an equally or even more qualified Asian applicant. And since there's been no legal basis to challenge this, the fact that Harvard doesn't technically have a preference for whites over Asians (even if true) doesn't really mean much."

There are so many misunderstandings about affirmative action. First of all, unlike many people would like to believe, it's not about having race quotas, or you being admitted solely on the fact that you are a certain race. 

Affirmative action is about placing importance on diversity.

Aptitude? What qualifies as aptitude? There's a reason why the lawyer in this case is laser-focused on GPA and standardized test scores. Because they know Asian people will gobble this shit up because this is their strongest factor into getting into colleges. Aptitude can be, extra circulars, field experience, artistic merit, athletic merit, leadership experience. So the repeal of AA would mean the erasure of these deciding factors, because ""scores"", which Asians love because it works in their favor. 

If this repeal is passed, it's defining aptitude as test scores and GPA, which is harmful in general in academia and education. There are really intelligent people, of all races, who are terrible at test taking. Solely looking at this would be harmful to this demographic. 

This is rigging the game so that you'll always win and the rules always favor you. Does this sound fair? Sounds a lot like cheating doesn't it?

So isn't that more about equity i.e. equality of outcomes? I don't get why we should strive for equality of outcome is all, today everyone has the same rights and if you're punishing some (requiring them to have a larger number of achievements or accolades to be accepted to a specific university) to raise up others then it's still discrimination to those punished because you've based it on their parents ethnicities.

I'm obviously in favor of looking at more than grades alone, I'm talking specifically about the ethnicity based weighting of your ""aptitudes.""


Basically, if we all have equal rights now in America then why are we trying to force things to be ""fair"" for everyone? And who gets to decide the balance of such a system? 

How am I promoting 'a rigged game that always favors me'?

Because the range of outcomes for under-represented minorities is so, so much worse than the ones that east asians generally face. Black, hispanic, and Native Americans are disproportionately subject to crippling poverty or death by crime. If some AAPI people go to a slightly less prestigious school so that our brothers and sisters of color can gtfo of poverty, then we should absolutely take that trade any day.

>if we all have equal rights now in America

This is your privilege talking. It is absolutely not the case that we all have ""equal rights"" now in America. You are not as likely to be stopped (with the subsequent risk of getting shot by a trigger-happy officer) by a police officer as someone with darker colored skin. You are not as likely to be born in a de-facto segregated and poor neighborhood that diminishes your chance at a decent life. For gender, assuming that you're male, you are still on average going to earn more money for doing the same job as someone who is a woman. The line I quoted from you is an assumption underlying your overall position, and it is a false one. Let me repeat - that assumption is your privilege talking. By ignoring the systemic inequalities that face other minorities (and education is one of many attempts to ameliorate these inequalities), you'd prefer to reshape this tool to your benefit at the cost of other minorities. You're grabbing the limited bottles of Tylenol when others are much sicker than you are. That is how you are ""promiting 'a rigged game that always favors [you].'""

All my comments above, of course, assumes that there is in fact a tradeoff between AAPI and other minorities in the affirmative action debate. Of course, this is a false narrative that white people repeat to pit minority against minority. There is absolutely no reason why t the college slot is a battle between under-represented minority and asian minority. There are also the whites that you're assuming ""earn"" or ""deserve"" the slots they receive. There is zero reason why the remedy for discrimination against AAPI in college admissions is to throw other minorities under the bus. Why not challenge legacy admissions, which clearly favors white applicants? "

The entire American college application process was designed to weed out a different high-achieving but ""undesirable"" minority (Jewish students) and it's still being used the same way. 

Holistic admissions are rooted in Western ideals of education (quasi-religious dedication, learning for learning's sake, the liberal arts) that run counter to the Asian student who lives in white people's heads (incapable of true passion, animalistic priorities, only good at ""hard"" fields like math or engineering). 

Most of the admissions strategies you'll see on Chinese-language forums are things like ""do an art portfolio to prove you're creative"" or ""put your kid in a writing camp"". Writing about your family or heritage is totally out of the question because the last thing you need to do is remind the admissions officers that you're a goddamn chink. 

I was pretty much raised for the sake of college admissions and I was smack dab in a hyper-competitive school filled with other kids like me. It was a traumatizing, mind-numbing experience. I'm still slowly unlearning all of the self-hatred and paranoia that was ground into me so I could stand a chance against some lazy white bitch who got to have an actual adolescence with family and trips to the mall and romance and whatever people are supposed to do. My parents made it very clear that I was not allowed to relax, ever, because I was Asian and I couldn't afford it. My Asian heritage became nothing more than a speedbump on the road to Harvard. 


**Affirmative action sets arbitrary numerical hoops that you have to jump through. Holistic admissions teach Asian children that being Asian is a shameful disease.** 

Getting rid of AA will do absolutely fuck all to a system that hates us to its core. And if we're gonna go down the ""work with people who hate you uwu"" path, Asian Americans as a community cannot afford to alienate other PoC or reinforce the idea that we're white (no matter how flimsy the reasoning). People are heads-over-heels in love with the narrative of a sniveling, mindless Asian who would do anything for a quick buck. We can't get away with stuff that reinforces that because we just don't have the fucking numbers to create social change on our own, especially when language barriers and the constant erasure of Asian Americans' very existence are still big problems.

But instead white conservatives have managed to convince Asian Americans as a whole that AA needs to be abolished because it unfairly puts black people and Hispanics above Asians, when it's really the complete opposite.

That also doesn't take into account that such a move undermines the political coalition building that is necessary to build a consensus across the very broad and diverse groups that are agglomerated under the umbrella ""Asian-American"" term.

King-Peasant,,"I'm well past my college years, and have long since graduated, but if i can give any college advice, I would say NEVER write an essay about how your parents were immigrants, and how the uphill battle of 1st generation immigrants helped shape your worldview. 

This is coming from someone who lived in Southern California with one of the largest Asian communities. Back then, I thought this would be a really powerful message, an underdog role who has achieved academic success, who doesn't root for the underdog? After the deadline passed, me and my closest friends decided to pass our essays to each other (we had a no idea stealing policy before deadline), and guess what? Almost all of us had the similar story, with different variations. I considered myself an EXTREMELY good writer in high school, but now that I'm more experienced, looking back, it read like 1st world kid complaining about 1st world problems, comical if not eye-rolling. (Bonus tip, don't write about negative things that hold you back, as cheesy as it sounds, write about positive experiences that make you want to explore/tackle the world. Don't try to frame ""language and cultural barriers"" as limitations to overcome either, it'll end up sound pitiful.) 

The essay question asking you to share an experience, family history, or life event that shaped your world view is a very common one. I call it the 1st generation trap. Many of us think it's a milestone to be 1st generation to do something and will write stories about ""1st gen immigrants with language barrier"", ""1st gen US born with immigrant parents who had language barriers"", ""1st gen college student who had parents who didnt go to college"", ""1st gen US college but parents went to college overseas"" that will all end up sounding very similar. If your younger siblings are applying to Ivy league private schools, make sure they always avoid these topics. 

Edit: I was still able to get accepted by a lot of UCs, but I was top 5-10%ile in class ranking, and lived in california (paid tax for UC schools).

nemracbackwards,ABC Olenna Tyrell. Don't @ me,">In 2012, Ron Unz, a former publisher of the American Conservative, argued that Ivy League schools have an Asian quota. His main piece of evidence was the lack of growth in the Asian-American population at Ivy League schools, despite the growing percentage of college-age Asians nationwide. As a counterexample, he compared Asian enrollment at these schools to Caltech, where they don’t have affirmative action:


>There are several flaws with this analysis. It assumes the quality of the Asian applicant pool has stayed the same as the population grows, as Poon points out.


>It also only looks at how many students enroll in the school, and not how many students are admitted to the school. Jenn Fang, who writes at Reappropriate.co, found that the limited growth in Asian-Americans students at Harvard wasn’t out of the ordinary:

We are being accurately represented in Ivy League admissions(NOT ENROLLMENT) in correlation to population. 

This means Asian kids are turning down offers to go to Ivy Leagues, maybe to go to a different Ivy League or another college altogether. So really, you should be just yelling at yourselves for not being able to attend multiple colleges (please don’t actually do this because some kids will get guilt tripped into doing something that physically impossible because of our weird desire to overchieve while killing ourselves so we can look pretty for the community) so you can boost the AA enrollment percentages for other grumpy Asians who would’ve never made it past the interview phase and has to vicariously live through other people so they can inflate their egos and blame the “system” for getting rejected.

As for differentiation, it's pretty notable every ivy league school's orchestra violin section is 2/3 or more asian, while asian representation is ivy league athletics is ~5% and limited to a few sports. There is significant, artificial selection in the AA applicant pool that ends up making it harder."
NotThatJosh,,"> I would say NEVER write an essay about how your parents were immigrants, and how the uphill battle of 1st generation immigrants helped shape your worldview... You gotta differentiate yourself from all the other Asians. 

The essay isn't really that important. 

When Michigan tried to get around the ban on quotas by calling it 'critical mass', they assigned 20 points for race but only a few points maximum for the essay.

And, I would point out that this advice to not write about overcoming the barriers of a 1rst gen immigrant only applies to Asian American applicants.

Colleges will deny it, but they're putting a cap on the number of AA applicants so they're comparing AA applicants against each other. We saw that with the Princeton admissions officers who  were comparing applicants to other applicants in the same ethnic group- they were saying stuff like this you don't see a lot of African Americans with scores like this when deciding whether or not to admit an African American student.

Let's say there's an AA applicant who's a first generation Asian American applicant whose family doesn't speak English and who came to this country with no money on a rickety boat fleeing sharks and war. This AA applicant is the first one in his family to go to college, and his parents are low paid cooks in some asian restaurant. 

To the college admission officer, this is going to sound very similar to 
all these other AA applicants with amazing scores who also had to overcome similar obstacles. 

But, if you're a Mexican- Amerian applicant with a similar life story who writes that essay, then the college is going to love that.

But it seemed like every poll before the election was predicting prop 16 was gonna eat shit. Especially among latinos which kinda surprised me. 

I wonder if it was because people had an issue with *how* it was implemented rather than whether they agreed with AA or not. Which I think seems to be the consensus with alot of people here too, who aren't opposed to AA but don't like how it's usually implemented (favoring white kids over asians which makes zero sense in the lens of systemic racism). All speculation but maybe people were afraid it was gonna be abused? Personally I was unsure too, there's alot of talk that they would do disaggregation for SEA and not unfairly penalize asians but nowhere in writing or even verbally has anyone guaranteed that they would do that. When asked about asians, senator Steven Bradford basically gave a non answer and said ""oh we'll just address them later but there's more important issues."" 

Talking with some of my latino friends who oppose 16, one point they made was that their UC populations have been growing over the years (i think they now make up the largest percentage) and they're afraid that in a couple of years affirmative action will be used against them too like for asians. I don't necessarily agree but i thought that was an interesting view. Many people, not just asians but latinos too, are disillusioned by what can look like yet another scam by white ppl and rich donors who don't have their best interests in mind. 

PS. The yes on 16 people really fucked up their campaigning. They literally had a 14:1 advantage in funding, tons of endorsements, and still fucked it up by giving vague non answer after answer and strawmanning in their commercials calling anyone who is no on 16 literally the KKK (not really the best way to win over anyone who was still on the fence)."

But this reality is exactly what drives so many Asian families to obsess over university prestige. The college crisis has never been about the marquee flagship schools - they're doing just fine. The median UCLA grad has a ticket to a six-figure salary and upper-middle class living.

The problem is with low-ranked schools and community colleges that produce a surplus of grads who never end up using their degree. That's where the perception of college not being ""worth it"" comes from. This also ties back to Prop 22, since plenty of college grads (but probably not the UCLA ones) do drive for Uber or Lyft, which does not require a degree. When you're unable to leverage your human capital in the form of education, you're more screwed than ever.

I think under-represented subgroups of Asian Americans would benefit from affirmative action for Asian Americans with disaggregation.

Edit: Prop 16 doesn’t seem to guarantee much, except for making it constitutional in the state to treat people differently based on race, national origin, etc. Even the official argument in support doesn’t read like clear policies to me. Some of the auxiliary arguments like helping Asian American businesses or helping subgroups of Asian Americans are good in principle, but it’s unclear to me what Prop 16 or other legislation does to implement these ideas in practice. However, while I think Prop 16 was flimsy, it’s worth discussing the merits (and problems) of different affirmative action policies.

Edit 2: For data collection, UCs have 16 options + Other for Asian Americans. In the comment below, I linked stats for how they used disaggregated data to track student outcomes at UCs, CSUs, and community colleges. Even UC Berkeley's online fall enrollment data has Chinese, **Filipino**, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, **Vietnamese**, and Other. In particular, UCSF defines ""**Filipino**, Hmong, or **Vietnamese**"" as under-represented minorities. Filipino, Vietnamese, and other under-represented groups would probably benefit from an affirmative action policy in higher education that disaggregates Asian Americans."

And those who make it through the door continue to face toxic work cultures rooted in racism. Having larger numbers in those industries would help some of those issues. I think a similar framing applies for affirmative action in universities. It's never been a pure meritocracy for admission because the metrics will always be incomplete---who is to say that the SAT is a good predictor of lifetime success? In fact, it's been shown to correlate more with socioeconomic status. Affirmative action allows universities to add more metrics to their evaluation.

AA is not an appropriate solution. Frankly the problem people seem to have but not want to admit is that there is bias towards caucasians which needs to be addressed, **maybe through pro-minority solutions that doesn't hurt 1 minority in favor of another minority**, rather than trying to make the diversity of higher education align closer to the general population to various minorities' detriment.

I have no inside information on admissions, but I think they do put less weight on language scores/essays if it's clear that the applicant is e.g. a refugee.

otterbe,,"So I see what you mean about Black and white students being equally represented at UCs, and that it's hard to make those statements without implicitly acknowledging that Asians are then overrepresented. But AA is not about quotas (or so it claims)! It's more about taking the Black underrepresentation as a symptom of the multitude of barriers that Black students face to get into higher education, including barriers in early education, in admissions, in the college experience, and in society in general. It's about acknowledging that those challenges exist, and evaluating Black applicants within that context. 

Wait, you don't think that a lot of the arguments against AA are rooted in white supremacism and racism? Arguments like, ""Why don't Black kids just work harder?"" without acknowledging that society and history are stacked against Black Americans such that it's not even an equal race? I hear a lot, ""We should be aiming for equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome,"" but let's be clear that college admissions is the opportunity, not the outcome. It remains in our country that higher education is a huge stepping stone for socioeconomic advancement, and that's why people are fighting for the spots at the table (and especially at elite universities). I haven't dived into the details of the Yale case, but a similar lawsuit at Harvard was led by a group with [strong white supremacist ties](https://tuftsobserver.org/the-real-winners-of-the-harvard-lawsuit/) (an additional article on Edward Blum [here](https://inthesetimes.com/article/abigail-fisher-affirmative-action-supreme-court-project-fair-representation)).

I mean, I feel like even well-intentioned and liberal white people don't always have much empathy for the Asian experience, and as long as white people are the ones making the decisions, their impacts are going to skew white-favoring. After all, they rose through the ranks as white people in a white-favoring system---how do we have confidence that they're going to radically overhaul it?"

While you won't face blatant discrimination, people will associate a whole host of stereotypes with you based on the color of your skin and this is perpetuated constantly by a racist media.

retrofuturist,,"Yes, I'd say I've come to understand better how racism is much more prevalent than I'd hoped. It's not just a holdover from older generations; it's embedded into the fabric of human society. 

I think the biggest epiphany I've had over the past few years--to which Reddit contributed greatly--is that I needed to stop trying to live up to the model minority label. It actually sets limits for how much Asians can accomplish and it certainly doesn't do other minorities any good. 

I've come to aspire less to emulating and assimilating into white culture, and shift focus instead toward understanding and cooperation with Hispanics, SE Asians, blacks, Indians, Armenians, Arabs, etc.

I think the model minority myth has made too many East Asians arrogant in thinking that they're better than other minorities, and that's a terrible lie to buy into."

I grew up in an immigrant Chinese family, and have heard racist, ignorant shit being spewed by my own father about every single race; so naturally I assumed other families were similar and didn't really give two shits when other kids tried to make fun of me for my eyes or how weird my food looked/smelled. I actually don't mind a joke or two at my expense as long as it's clever and good-humored.

For me, reddit really only offered me a window to browse the views that others have. For instance, I never knew that there were still people as ignorant and disgusting as those over at /r/coontown (though I believe it got taken down?) - it was both interesting and appalling to read into how they justify their ""not racist"" bashing of Africans/African Americans.

Of course, reality is that none of these things are true. Bitcoins is dying, Bernie Sanders is polling at 13%, and Gamergate is the pathetic flailings of internet manbabies that no one cares about.

Same thing for Racism. Not that racism doesn't exist in the real world, but that if you judge on a curve, it's a lot better than reddit presents it. I think u/LGBTLibrarian had a great insight into Reddit racism. In that it's perpetrated by the outcasts of the privileged classes, not its rank and file. The white people on  Reddit that lash out against minorities do so not because they are on top, but because by and large, they’re losers who don’t even enjoy the privileges they “should” have. They’re the people who join the KKK and neo-nazi groups. Not your normal average person, but the bottom of the barrel.

They say ""don't be so oversensitive"" yet when they go to any Asian country, they whine about being discriminated. There's a difference between being ignorant because of lack of exposure and being intentionally discriminatory. Learn the difference. For the US, it's so nice that you mock Chinese people at an official AP World History testing site. Yes, official.

 It's so nice that you manage to mix up Chinese people and Vietnamese people ( see Lewiston Maine). ""Ho Chi Chin"" is stupid as fuck. And if you know history, a lot of Chinese people came here to get away from the Cultural Revolution, and Vietnamese-Americans are majority refugees that lost everything to the VC regime. Nice.

Developmental age (teenagers)? What part of America (presumably) are they from? Are they from a working class or professional background? Or are there no such correlations to these people's worldview? 

Just yesterday ago I quickly noped out of a major thread in r/diablo. This ""SJW"" problem is difficult to resolve, partly because you have people lacking in empathic skills, maybe due to limited exposure to American minorities. From a limited vantage point, they tend to make the mistake of prejudging other people's lived experiences, thus accusing SJW's of being extremist, entitled, irrational, and all sorts of other labels.

And partly it's about supposing if SJW's were right - then these people would feel very guilty because they're the ones causing the microaggressions, etc. Instead of being reflective about this like a mature person (and sadly most adults are bad at this too), it's much less effort to rationalize the opposite and hastily conclude that SJW's are clearly crazy. So there may be deep factors such as ego, sense of self-worth, and identity involved in these thought processes in trying to reason about groups of people not like yourself. Humans are flawed like that, in general.

Honestly?   Unless a white person has proved to you over time they understand how race works in America you should assume they are racist to at least some degree.  Unless they've had some experience that has made them question the white supremacy and their place in it they WILL have some racism in them.  That doesn't mean they are bad people though or don't have the potential to understand but I think this is a safe assumption all non white people in America should operate from.   Once you understand that dealing with and  understanding them becomes way easier. 


I had a black friend from Atlanta, where people sre more openly racially segregated, who moved to the bay area where there is cultural pressure to be not racist, who assumed that because a white person was friendly or talking to him that meant they weren't racist.

By your theory, at best, only the top 50th percentile of whites will not be *overtly* racist. Reddit actually explains how society maintains racial privilege in the background through subconscious biases, influencing laws and media perception of the other--it isn't usually what your (white) co-worker does in front of you. 

It answers the question how certain power structures continue to exist in a colorblind, 'postracial' society that claims  racism/racialization is no longer a factor for non-whites.

If affirmative action were to be lifted and purely merit based entries, it wouldn't take long for white parents to be outraged by the unfairness of the system because schools only look at test scores and don't take into account the ""character"" of their little jimmy. 

While I agree with the sentiment that APAs should be graded on a FAIR scale- I have little faith that the group behind this court challenge is acting on the best interests of APAs. They're simply using us as a vehicle for their greater argument and as soon as affirmative action as lifted and schools start letting in larger numbers of asians over whites, they'll find a new way to suppress asian admissions.

Bakke*) in that race may be considered alongside other factors such as financial background, test scores, family background, etc.

Regardless, isn't it the general consensus that the UC system would be mostly Asian with or without affirmative action? I may be wrong here, so please explain.

Meanwhile, down South in Texas, I imagine the UT system eventually becoming similar except mostly Hispanic and Asian. Apparently, Hispanic and Asian account for almost 38% at UT-Austin (my *alma mater*), and I imagine that number getting much larger in a few years because affirmative action implicitly exists via the ""Top 10% Rule."""

You are 100% correct. My high school is from a very high Asian population city in the Bay Area. When I was a student, I read about ""white flight"" that was happening in our city. White families were getting uncomfortable that more and more Asian families were moving in. As a result, it was harder for people to get good grades since most classes were curved. First they complained to the schools to limit the STEM classes or to make them easier. That didn't work, so they moved away. When I was a student AA population at my hs was 60%. A decade and some later, it's something like 85% now.

I'm actually just comparing Harvard AAs to MIT AAs, as they make up a lot of our applicants over the years.

The MIT students come across as brilliant, no doubt. Always on point and very, very quick with the logic and calculations of the problem. Our brain teasers aren't very hard and they pretty much never get stumped on them. But generally speaking - they can end up speaking too fast and lose coherence, either out of nervousness or overexcitement, they can lose structure and momentum when explaining something, they can get too caught up in details that are interesting but irrelevant.

What's immediate about many of the Harvard students is how damn articulate they are, it honestly sometimes blows my mind (and they end up going to McKinsey or something lol). Very calm, composed in their answers - their weakness (and the weakness of most students anywhere we interview), is typically not having a sufficiently rigorous enough response or messing up the math.

My personal feeling is that there is nothing wrong with either Asian American or AAPI as an umbrella term, but that's probably because within the AA community *we* know all that ""Asian"" entails. From the outside looking in (or maybe just looking in the general direction), I know that ""Asian American"" can often become short hand for ""only East Asian Americans"".

From the outside looking in, there's NEVER going to be a good umbrella term because it's just that—an umbrella term. I don't think there's really any point in asking if these terms have done us harm because people who don't wish to understand the nuance of our community aren't going to even if we do away with ""AA"" and ""AAPI"" altogether and demand that non-Asians only refer to our communities based on our original ethnic groups. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Certainly, there are a lot of POVs that are covered under the umbrella of Asian diaspora, and I think you have to take statistics/demographic in mind when it comes to internet spaces and mainstream culture.

I KNOW I don't fit in because I can't be bothered/don't care/don't want to, not because I feel that my desire to fit in has been rejected, therefore I'm not broken up about it. It's enough, to me, to simply see my ethnicity as my culture, not my nationality."

I’m the same way with my gender, that it’s just a fact about me like my age. Of course I feel strongly when I or others are mistreated because of gender, but I wouldn’t really care if I had happened to be born in a different body."

If I say ""I'm Asian"" in my dumb midwestern accent and someone else can't hear the silent ""American"" after it, that's not my problem. It also doesn't suddenly change the country on my passport lol.

To me nationality is like age where it sort of exists in the back of my mind as an answer to a question and a factor to my overall life experience. But age is also like race/ethnicity in that you cannot change it by your own power and more often than not it will be immediately visible.

Therefore, I do feel that being Chinese/Asian is something I identify with more, but like I said, I don't necessarily fit in with the mainstream culture, so it's more of a thing where ""I am Chinese and this is how/this is my personality""."
msndrstdmstrmnd,,"Oh yeah context is definitely huge, and I don’t say “Asian American” 24/7, it’s a long phrase and it can be assumed in many cases. When I’m in my white af hometown I just say Asian, when I was at uni where there were a lot of international students I said Asian American, when I was in Korea I just straight up said American. I guess since getting older ive been in more contexts where “American” couldn’t be assumed, so I just take it on more to differentiate from international Asian, when there was no need to before.

I had hated being Asian when I was younger, then went through a journey to unlearn that and embrace it. Then I hated being American for a while, and it was a whole other journey to realize I don’t need to be. 

In terms of passport, that one is more of a descriptor to me. I exclusively had a Korean passport when I was young, and I exclusively have the US passport now, but I’m still the same person, apart from voting rights and stress levels about immigration status. Actually when I was young my parents told me I couldn’t be “Asian American” because I didn’t have a US passport which was kind of upsetting"

Because ideal White standards paint it that way.

Instead of making Whites look like they have heavy disdain for minorities, it's easier to move the goalposts and make minorities feel like they have to fight over each other.

I finally landed a great job with a huge international corporation after I aced the aptitude test they gave all job applicants and providing several years of experience for the position (in the military).  A few years later after affirmative action became the law of the land, I overheard a few co-workers complain about how I got my job  because I was of a minority race and the company felt obligated to hire me to fill their 'quota'.

http://www.hillel.org/college-guide/list/record/harvard-university

- Are racial quotas protecting Asian representation in place in any institutions at all? Do we get guaranteed 5% representation in media? Or leadership positions? In government? In sports? Or does the unlikable, not-leader-material, don't-really-trust-this-Asian stereotype follow us everywhere? 

- What if roles were reversed and Black and Latinx student admissions exceeded their % of population in the US. Would Harvard start coming up with arbitrary reasons to get that number down to ""acceptable"" levels? What would the reaction to Harvard intentionally keeping those groups out? 

- I don't give a fuck about Edward Blum. I'm weighing the issue on its merits. Even though I'm politically leftwing, I'm not the type of person to think drone strikes are evil when Bush does it but cool when Obama does it. I view Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba a good thing, and Trump's lowering of tension with North Korea a good thing, even though Trump is evil, an idiot, and someone I despise. At the end of the day, I'm not a partisan.

Both schools have high Asian enrollment and there are efforts to increase the enrollment of under-represented minorities in both. Interestingly, the former school superintendent of SFUSD, Richard Carranza, now holds that position in New York. The main difference I see is that Asian-Americans are actually the largest racial group in SF although their enrollment at Lowell is almost double their percentage city-wide.  "
InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,[This piece in the NYT](https://nyti.ms/2MvS1br) gives a more nuanced than usual appraisal of how Asian Americans see affirmative action. 
ABCinNYC98,,"As a former graduate of one of these SHSAT High Schools, I believe there are many facts left out of discussion because unless you went through the NYC Board of Ed. public school system you are not aware of the various programs used to help Black and Hispanic children to do better in school.  But unfortunately, they are still not able to compete for these limited seats in large number when it comes to SHSAT placement.

For those of you that are unaware NYC high schools are not zoned.  You are allow to rank 21 (or 50? can't remember) high schools you wish to be placed in.  Even the SHSAT high school.  So if you rank an SHSAT high school last, and got a good score on the SHSAT, you might not get an invitation.  I find that scenario rare.  But if you're SHSAT high school bound, ranking the 8 SHSAT high school in a particular order will change the cut off score you need to get an invitation.

The second point I read a lot is some how Asian are cheating by going to private cram or after school programs.  I don't think people are aware of the ""Discovery Program"" where JHS students with high enough grades offered free after school classes to prepare for the SHSAT.  Originally it was only for Blacks and Hispanic students.  That was ruled to be discriminatory, so it's now open to everyone.

The third point, NYC has dozens, if not  hundreds, of charter JHS and HS throughout the city to replace failing public schools.  They have a 5 year charter that allows them to be selective with their student body to keep out problem students.  However, there are reports that even the charter JHS in NYC could not produce students that could get an invitation to Stuyvesant 2 years ago.  Don't know if the situation has changed since then.

This problem get brought up every couple of years.  My take on it is that in NYC minorities make a large population within city government jobs.  So there's political pressure to get something done.  Unfortunately the approach is not effective.  By reintroducing institutional racism to the admission process, just because the institutions are run by a minority group that makes a majority, is not a solution to racism per say.

Let alone developing a workforce that can compete with other countries, like China for instance."

You can be for affirmative action and be against racial quotas for example.

Affirmative action means favoring action or policy that helps those who were discriminated. Nothing in that description states that we must single out Asians and demand they sacrifice their opportunity at an ivy league education. We should be asking if the richest school in the world even needs to cut their Asian student population to accommodate more black and brown students, be it financial or academic."

Don't agree with this- isn't the whole problem we as am have with affirmative action is that we're forced to score higher than white people? The fuck does this have to do with black people? 

The author claims that asians benefit from affirmative action- then why do asians have to score over 100 points more on the SAT than white people? Yes since affirmative action started we've been overrepresented in college seats- but only because we achieved it in *spite* of our race, not because of it lmao.

Whackthemoles,," I hate how whenever people talk about affirmative action, they just sit around comparing test scores and GPAs as a measure of who “deserved” an acceptance more. Colleges want *unique* individuals so if you grew up in an nice, middle class family and did nothing but study study study throughout high school to get a 4.0+ GPA and 2000+ SAT scores then you’re no different from 90% of the applicants top colleges receive. Colleges make you write essays in your applications for a reason and if the only interesting thing you have to talk about is how your mandatory high school community service “changed your life” then you’re just the same boring carbon copy of every student they’ve been admitting for decades. It’s not hard to get good scores when your upbringing gives you the privilege of a comfortable life to focus solely on school with every resource available for you to succeed.

However a lot of minority student (specifically black and Latino) grow up in low-income neighborhoods where graduating high school is a big challenge. A lot of people like to look at scores and say “hey this black kid had a 3.9 GPA and a 1900 SAT score. The *only* reason they were accepted is because of their race” when in reality they grew up with a single parent who was barely around because they were working two jobs and the kid had to get a job as a teen to help support the family while growing up in a gang infested neighborbood with terrible public schools. So that minority kid may have lower stats on average but had to put 10x as much effort as the average, middle class kid which makes them stand out and look incredibly impressive to colleges.

Basically, I’m saying college essays matter because they who you are outside of those numbers and if your life painfully average then your essays are most likely going to be boring. You can’t just compare numbers because colleges want to see who you are as a person.

Not to mention that where you live will change the value of that income substantially (i.e. $100k in San Francisco vs. South Carolina). Plus, the wealth that exists in an extended family can make a huge difference compared to just looking at your parents. The added complication is that some analyses of wealth vs. income show that wealth disparities often fall along race lines differently, so you can't just assume it will all cancel itself out. So you would need administrators to take apart financial aid documents of every single applicant through all these insane nuances, which in these schools with like a 5% admission means 20 in-depth reviews for every admittance (you can maybe weed them out by grades/essays first, but either way you'll still need to hire more administrative staff).

For a lot of AAPIs, they had to focus on their grades so as to not feel useless to their families. Are these experiences meant to weigh less to college admission services compared to the low income black applicant that grew up in a single household purely because there’s a less amount of African American success stories? 

Let’s even take into consideration the fact that Southeast Asians have a significantly higher amount of high school drop out rates than most other AAPIs due to poor home conditions or poor minority support in the USA due to being Asian. Should a college admission office see a SEAA apply with lower than the average Asian American SAT scores and GPA and consider their SEA background? No, they’re going to compare them with other Asian Americans that traditionally have higher scores anyway. They’re definitely NOT going to compare them to other low income blacks.

You’re right, I also didn’t factor in the interviews, however, I don’t see why you view this as a negative. Colleges also do tend to value sociable people with good interpersonal skills the same way employers do so if Asians don’t do as well in the interviews, then it makes sense that they aren’t accepted as often.

> It's not like there's a shortage of poor people from other racial backgrounds.

How do you know that poor people from other backgrounds aren’t being helped? I’m sure their hardships are taken into account in their college essays and interviews. Currently black and Latino people suffer from poverty the most in America which is why colleges take their backgrounds into account the most. 

However, it is worth noting that the poverty many black Americans suffer is a direct result of their race. There are millions of black people who alive today who grew up during Jim Crow laws along with millions of  black people today who legally weren’t allowed to buy a house in the 70’s because of housing discrimination. The poverty they and their families suffer today is very different from what a white family suffers.

"
Whackthemoles,,"> so Asian kids need to be punished because their parents provided a good life for them? 

No, they can just become more well rounded. A lot of the college advice I was given in high school is that grades and scores aren’t enough. You need to be well-rounded. Asian kids who grew up in a nice life should join clubs, play sports, take on leadership roles in organizations, but so many Asian parents thinks grades are the only thing that matters and don’t let their kids do anything other than study. No one is being punished for giving their kids a good life but the bottom line is that if your parents have money then your life is easier and you have access to more resources. People have no problem acknowledging this when it comes to Rich vs Middle class but for some reason get offended when it’s middle class vs lower class. 

> There are a lot of poor Chinese living in enclaves like chinatown

It is not punishing the privileged to recognize the composite accomplishment of those who had less, and having privilege does not necessitate that you truly are capable of more.

My point is that an average rich person will look quite impressive outcomes wise. Basically, a 1500 SAT (an outcome) isn't very impressive if you're raised wealthy, because much what's driving it above the average is not necessarily ability (talent) but is also very likely wealth and upbringing.

So much so that law schools and colleges refuse to publish results of those who are granted admission who fit the affirmative action criteria. We also know that in the top schools a disproportionate amount of those who are let in via affirmative action drop out at much higher rates, graduate with lower gpas, and are much more likely to not further their education in graduate school, or they are more likely to switch to less demanding majors. If you have the tine you could listen to “three miles” which is a NPR broadcast about talented students from a poor school who are granted access to the top universities via a program.

Again, this is all very STEM biased. And not even STEM departments are always competitive. There are many top schools that are the opposite of hyper competitive.

It’s far better to just come out and have an unfair policy than to say that it’s in service of “fairness” while actually discriminating against Asians."
night_owl_72,,I guess the difference is that in China I don’t think they try to dress it up as being fair or equitable in the same way that they do in the US.

But instead of doing even a modicum of research, I get a slew of replies and downvotes saying ""But it still LOOKS like a quota to me, therefore you're wrong!!!!11!"" So why the fuck would I bother explaining to people when they couldn't even do the most basic of searches? It's utterly pointless. And in fact, it's proving my original post exactly right when I said that a lot of people have misconceptions about AA and refuse to educate themselves. These cases by themselves pretty much cover all the objections that people have tried to ""gotcha"" me with.

BTW, these rulings about AA specifically deal with race. Using other factors like personality tests, social factors, income, etc. all potentially impact race but according to the Supreme Court, they are all fair game. A lot of AA programs may look like a quota and may even have results similar to what a quota would give, without actually being what the Supreme Court would consider a quota."

They shouldn't have used CA, affirmative action is actually banned. CSU generally accept everyone in the surrounding community. UC limit their Asian American population unintentionally.

In addition, hypothetically in terms of number and their scale unit, UC has a quota of top 20 of each high school, that would limit Asian-American since Asian-Americans generally congregate in one area.

I have a problem with what she says here. ""Resentment and social peace"" are not great reasons to cull the potential of asian kids. I see the need for affirmative action.

calf,,"I really like this piece for its clarity and the paragraph in the middle is especially elegant, where it argues how the intrinsic dishonesty of the prohibition on quota/balancing leads to the implication of structural racism that reinforces the attitude of ""All Asians look the same"".

That said, I'd raise two concerns about Prof. Gersen's argument. I get that when Prof. Gersen is expressing her personal opinion that a Stuyvesant demographic is undesirable for Harvard, but I think in saying that she fails to see the radical alternative—suppose that Harvard quickly became a majority Asian student body. That would be amazing. But she says no, that would be socially unstable—I see that sort of appeal/dismissal as a choice or failure to to consider and confront the final implication of her otherwise clear reasoning, which really has this alternative, radical interpretation as a last step.

I think the other issue is that the author doesn't seem to see that the effective racial/Asian balancing is an artifact of the system of quota doctrine + holistic-intangible evaluation. She says that race-conscious affirmative action is not a suitable point of intervention (sure, reasonable) but then says there is ""sub-rosa deployment of racial balancing"", which is equivalent to saying there's a conspiracy to do so. There's no conspiracy; social theorists say that modern discrimination happens structurally and to fix it you have to intervene at the level of structures. So pessimistically, I think getting Harvard to do anything will not work because they have no incentive to break the structure.

Her final message of hope, that regardless of this stuff is improving for Asian Americans anyways, is also heartening to read.

What studies do you see that say AA is worse than legacies? I'm interested.

EDIT: A big thing that just occured to me. An argument is always that legacy admissions are such as small part of the overall class that they don't matter. I disagree, because I've seen legacy admit numbers tend to be in the 5-10% range of the entire student body, which, while small taken alone, makes all the difference. For example, AAs make up 6% of the student body at Penn state. There are probably more Legacy Admits than Asian-American students at Penn State.

That’s 22 points that certain affluent and middle-class students had built in that poor, first-generation college students had little or no access to. This structure rewarded students who already benefited from living in upscale neighborhoods, who had successful parents or parents who, at the very least, knew how to succeed in “the system,” and who continued to benefit from the affirmative action of not descending from people who for generations were banned from reading, buying property, and living in safe neighborhoods with decent schools.

> Somehow, advantages of this sort are often invisible to the general public. And if they’re made visible, the most coddled people in American society tend to get their feelings hurt—and insist on their self-worth."
manitobot,,Uh reparations? No that shouldn't be a reason either.
Afdrmgt,,"Have people been arguing for affirmative action as a way to promote white people learning from minorities? Or is this article sort of just interpreting generic 'diversity' as meaning that? I wasn't aware that people thought about diversity that way.

The idea of reparations makes sense, in that a society should 'compensate' people who have been treated badly for reasons that were wrong in retrospect. In that sense Asians should benefit too, especially the students that didn't grow up with highly educated parents, etc. The word 'reparations' seems to have a bad connotation though, as a blanket benefit for everyone of a certain race, whereas I think most people would agree that affirmative action would be better administered looking at individuals' specific background.

This reminds me of the article about who benefits from elite college educations ([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/)). A more cynical/rational way to look at a benefit of affirmative action is that it increases the number of people in society who go on to high-value activities. The white guys will get into good jobs regardless of where they go to school, but only an elite education boosts minorities into similar jobs. So affirmative action -> the greatest marginal benefit to society. I'm not sure where that argument fits on the spectrum of whether affirmative action benefits white people or the minorities."
,,"Agreed. Whichever reason it is, it's ridiculous for it to be at the expense of Asian people instead of white people who already makes up the majority of university students anyway.

If it's about reparations, all the more reason to avoid harming Asian Americans, as a lot came from countries that have been colonised, occupied, or generally fucked over by the US govt these past decades. "

While I don't agree with the diversity rationale, this has got to be one of the most absurd characterizations of AA I've ever heard. It's nothing but a net positive for the people who benefit because all it does is give the more choice.

If they want to attend an elite school that's not as diverse, that's their choice. If they want to choose a less prestigious but more racially diverse school, that's still an option. Nobody is demanding that these students engage in a particular environment or be educators to white people."
,,"indeed, extra point during college admission is no excuse for shitty schools during primary and secondary education. The later is actually what will help minorties, and those who wants to keep minorities down knows it as well.

If we really want to even the playing field, we should get rid of the de facto segregated school disctrict and start bus kids and teachers between those ranked 8 and above (normally in wealthy suburbs) and those that ranked 5 and below (normally in inner cities)."

Yes, immediately after prop 209, URM enrollment went down, but if you look at the numbers now, the enrollment is in line with pre-209 levels. What happened? Instead of accepting students who come from weaker educational backgrounds based on their race, UCLA helped foster stronger applicants through supplemantary educational programs and structural programs for teachers/guidance counselors. As an aside, URM have lower graduation rates than white ppl/asian. So while AA helped them make it into college, it did not help them excel there. The pipeline that UCLA created does both— it levels the education disparity for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from those from higher ones and thus it makes students stronger applicants  during the college process.

finding consistent with the argument that affirmative action bans result in better matching

>In contrast to the results on enrollment, minority college graduation rates, both on-time

rates tend to be larger at either the less-selective UC campuses (for African Americans) or
the CSU system (Hispanics). Again, these patterns show up in our unadjusted tabulations and
our model-based estimates using IPEDS data.

likely to graduate from a UC campus post-Prop 209, even after one controls for direct and
indirect measures of pre-college preparation and family background. The improvements over
pre-Prop 209 graduation rates range from 3% to 7% depending on the controls used. Moreover,
the increase in graduation rates for minorities are substantially larger than the corresponding
estimates for other racial/ethnic groups.


>The ontime
graduation rates of African Americans went up by 0.025 for a 23.1% increase after Prop
209 and by 0.034 in the 6-year graduation rate for a 9.3% increase. Hispanic on-time graduation
rates at public colleges increased 0.033 for a 23.8% improvement and increased 0.030 for a 6.4%
improvement in 6-year graduation rates. Moreover, the graduation rates of minority enrollees
improved in both the UC and CSU systems, with the size of improvements in graduation rates
greater for UC campuses but with larger relative improvements at CSU campuses. Finally,
minority graduation rates improved, post-Prop 209, in California’s private colleges, even though
the latter group was not subject to this law. Below, we provide some limited evidence that these
improvements in minority graduation rates at private colleges may have been the result of a
change (improvement) in the academic preparedness of minority students entering these schools
after Prop 209 went into effect....the graduation rates of students enrolled at a public college that
declined to state their race or ethnicity with the passage of Prop 209 also increased after Prop
209 went into effect, by 0.056 for on-time graduation (a 24% improvement) and by 0.045 in
6-year graduation rates (a 8.0% improvement).


>We also find improvements in rates of college degree attainment with Prop 209 for minorities
at California’s public colleges [Table 5]. The number of on-time graduations from a public college
relative to the number of public high school graduates improved for both African Americans and
Hispanics with the implementation of Prop 209. Again, we find improvement in on-time college
attainment rates at California’s private colleges post Prop 209.


>While the enrollment rates of African American and Hispanics declined at the Top 50 (ranked)
UC campuses, they actually increased at non-Top 50 UC campuses (UC Riverside and UC Santa
Cruz). 


>Finally, we found that Prop
209 did result in higher minority graduation rates [Table 10], even after we netted out the effects
of changes in the academic and parental backgrounds of minorities that accompanied Prop 209.

>Chicano/Latino enrollment percentage, after several years of decreases, dramatically increased from the lowest 11.3% in 1998 to 20.7% in 2010. In contrast, White enrollment percentage, after achieving a high of 40.2% in 1997, decreased significantly to 26.8% in 2010.

Hahalollawl,,"The fight against insidious discrimination is a constant battle because this type of discrimination tends to rely on primitive instincts. I'm not sure it will ever be completely eliminated so in that sense I agree and acknowledge that the fight against racial discrimination could be a fight that continues. But the question here is not whether discrimination will continue to exist, but whether affirmative action should continue to be used as a tool for fighting discrimination forever (it is, of course, not the only tool for doing so). I do not think affirmative action should be seen as an acceptable part of the status quo in perpetuity, but rather, in my opinion, affirmative action is an extraordinary (and temporary) remedy for an extraordinary problem.

&#x200B;

That extraordinary problem that justifies affirmative action in my opinion is not future racial discrimination, which I agree is a problem likely to exist in various forms for various minorities. Rather the extraordinary problem (in my opinion) is the significant disadvantages that currently exist for some minorities as a result of PAST discrimination, which has created a structure/hierarchy that causes some people to start off at a disadvantage in terms of reaching higher education. This is why some groups of Asians, who are represented but also do face racial discrimination to this day, should not benefit from affirmative action. Because we have already achieved something at least close to adequate representation, and thus overcome the obstacles to higher education placed in our way by past discrimination. (Note: this is only for higher education, not all areas. If, for example, some form of affirmative action for Asians in entertainment, as in Asian actors, were suggested I think it could be worth considering because Asians continue to be hurt and under represented as a result of a system that hurts Asians).

&#x200B;

Therefore, an important part of the rationale for affirmative action, and one that is particularly convincing to me, is to make up for past harms and disadvantages that exist because of those past harms. I believe the under representation of certain minorities in certain high paying/high status/powerful positions can be traced to disadvantages due to terrible racism in the past. Affirmative action that helps to make up for those harms by increasing representation is justified in my opinion. Also, I think it is very important for young minorities to have role models to look up to, who show them that success is possible. However, if/when we reach a point where representation of minorities is a decent reflection of society and those role models exist in adequate numbers, then that justification starts to recede and I think we can start to dial back affirmative action.

&#x200B;

Another potential rationale for affirmative action, as I think you suggest, is to protect against future disadvantages that result from discrimination against minorities. I do not think this is a sufficient justification for affirmative action. Should we be alert and constantly aware that discrimination may be harming certain minorities and try to eliminate that wherever we can? Absolutely. But like any other problem, I think we need to identify it and address it as it comes up, not preempt/anticipate it through affirmative action. And when those minorities achieve better representation in more wealthy/powerful positions, they themselves will be in a better position to address those problems. Could there be some degree of backslide? I admit that it is possible. But in my opinion that is not sufficient justification for affirmative action and at the very least, if we reach a point where affirmative action is no longer necessary those  minorities will be in a better position to fight it.

&#x200B;

I do not agree that this is the same situation as the Voting Rights Act. Affirmative action/representation is a problem of degrees of advantages and disadvantages relative to the majority due/in response to past discrimination. The Voting Rights Act did not give minorities an advantage (like additional voting power/rights) to make up for past harms, rather it ensured they would have the same right/power to vote as anyone else. It stands on far stronger footing in that regard. Efforts to disenfranchise minorities are trying to give minorities LESS rights/power than others. The justification for EQUAL treatment is much stronger than the justification for UNEQUAL treatment. The fact that affirmative action is unequal treatment is what makes it far more difficult to justify and therefore why it requires a stronger justification in my opinion (past discrimination). And for any states rights folks who want to nitpick, no I don't care that the VRA allowed for unequal treatment of states.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Affirmative action is unequal treatment, and therefore an extraordinary remedy that should only be applied to an extraordinary problem. Past discrimination that has caused significant harm and created significant structural disadvantages for some minorities is a sufficiently extraordinary problem in my opinion, but once the structural disadvantage is remedied to a sufficient degree (which I do not believe it has been yet), future potential threats of discrimination are not a sufficient justification. In my opinion those threats should be dealt with as they arise."

If we really stop to think how we got in this mess, consider this: As you said, it's been a dirty open secret for over a decade that Asians have it the hardest for university admissions. The overwhelming response to this state of affairs by the vast majority of Americans was, ""Haha, so what?"""

shreddedrabbit,,"> But is the solution to strike down affirmative action and hamstring disadvantaged racial minorities across the board for the sake of a few lucky Asians every year?

This is interesting, because it depends on your idea of what is fair.

The absurdity of this claim may be clear to you, but it's too subjective to render as fact.

And people griping about how ""they're perpetuating the stereotypes that just because we're hardworking and good academically doesn't mean we don't have personalities!""  But how many of them wrote college essays or had college resumes/portfolios that actually told the admissions people something that made them unique, instead of writinf an artfully crafted essay about how their parents ""struggled to make the American dream true for their children"", or how some internship or summer working opportunity made them realize the importance of kindness and patience?  Or any number of cliche essay topics that admissions staff from every college/university known to mankind have read a million times over?

In both competitive and non competitive schools the graduation rates were much higher. You could debate that it hurt blacks from entering into more competitive institutions, but you could also turn around and say they entered into better fitting institutions based on their credentials at higher rates and graduated at higher rates. Asians and Latinos both undoubtedly benefited on all fronts. Lastly, even if you're so adamantly against overturning Affirmative action, you cannot argue in good faith that it would be cataclysmic to any one group from the natural experiment which played out in California.

It's not useful on its own because you provided raw data, not any statistical measures. That's why I said ""There’s a reason why we use statistical analysis in research instead of raw data, even at the most basic level"". Statistics puts the data into context. So while you tried to attack your opponents data as misleading,  really only the facts you provided have no significant meaning because they are just raw numbers.

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"IRVINE, Calif. — George Li grew up in a Chinese society that he felt did not offer a fair shake. The government of Mao Zedong deemed his family capitalists and imprisoned his father.

So when Mr. Li moved to California in 1999, he felt he had found his American dream. He worked hard and earned his rewards: a master’s degree, then a job that allowed him to live comfortably with his wife and two children.

But four years ago, he became alarmed when a co-worker told him about a state measure that would allow California’s public universities to use affirmative action in their admissions. Fearing that this would hurt his children’s educational chances, Mr. Li for the first time in his life became politically active.

He signed a petition and donated money to a campaign to stop the affirmative action measure. He sped up his timeline to become a citizen so that he could vote. He campaigned for Republican candidates for the State Legislature. More recently, he took the lead of a local Chinese-American political action committee, called The Orange Club, which is now focused on supporting California Republican candidates in the midterms.

“We just realized if we’re not involved in this process, the political process in America, we would be forgotten,” Mr. Li said.

Mr. Li, 49, is among an increasingly vocal group of Chinese-Americans who were once politically dormant but have been galvanized by the fight over race-based school admissions.

[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.]

From Irvine to Houston to the Washington suburbs, Chinese activist groups like The Orange Club are beginning to capture the attention of lawmakers and influence policy debates. Much of their political activity can be found on the Chinese social media network WeChat, where the activists share articles and spread their message. And they have a clear litmus test for any politician seeking their support: opposition to affirmative action.

Their numbers are small compared with the overall population of China-born immigrants, which has exploded over recent decades, from about 472,000 in 1980 to more than 2.8 million in 2016, according to Andrew Beveridge, a professor at Queens College, based on census data.

‘Still Can’t Believe It Worked’: The Story of the Thailand Cave Rescue

Inside Nicaragua’s Protest Movement

An Extremely Detailed Map of the 2016 Presidential Election
But a number of recent fights over education have highlighted their growing political clout. Dozens of Chinese-American groups helped draft a complaint filed with the Justice Department in 2015 that accuses Harvard of discriminating against Asian-Americans in admissions. They were on the front lines of protests several weeks ago when Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York proposed changing the admissions criteria for his city’s specialized high schools, where Asian-Americans account for more than half the population.

The activists have yielded victories. In California, they helped defeat the affirmative action measure, known as S.C.A. 5. And in New York, the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, initially supported Mr. de Blasio’s plan, only to backtrack after the uproar led by Chinese-Americans.

The debate over race in education centers on how much schools should try to control their racial makeup. At many elite universities and specialized high schools, black and Hispanic students are underrepresented, while Asian and white students are overrepresented relative to their overall population.

Activists like Mr. Li worry that if schools calibrate their student ratios around race, Asian students are most likely to lose out.

The Orange Club grew out of a group of mostly Chinese-American mothers in Orange County who helped new immigrants navigate the school system and the community. When the affirmative action measure emerged in 2014, several parents in the group began asking what they could do to stop it, said Sarah Yang, who was among those who then founded The Orange Club.

Ms. Yang has a 19-year-old son who will be a sophomore at the University of Chicago, and a 16-year-old daughter who is entering 11th grade in high school.

While the University of Chicago was one of her son’s top choices, Ms. Yang said that there were other elite schools he did not get into.

“Nobody knows for sure what played a role in the decision making,” she said. “But I think in general, race is a part of the equation. How significant, we don’t know. We all understand for Asian kids you must do better in every way in order to get into college compared to other races.”

Ms. Yang said her daughter is mindful of the high standards she faces as an Asian-American to get into elite colleges, and she places extra pressure on herself.

“That’s something that I feel that’s not fair in a way,” Ms. Yang said. “They have to work extremely hard in order to get into their dream school.”

[Read about the Z-list, and other ways of getting into Harvard that it doesn’t want you to know about.]

Ms. Yang said she was familiar with racial struggle. She had to overcome a lot of challenges to become the vice president of engineering at a technology company dominated by white men. Schools, she said, should be the great equalizer, a place where your race or gender should not give you an advantage.

But affirmative action turned that notion on its head, Ms. Yang said. Of S.C.A. 5, she said, “I didn’t think that the U.S. could have such an unfair bill.”"

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"During the fight over the measure, Ms. Yang and other Chinese-Americans in Orange County held meetings, handed out fliers and signed online petitions. They protested in front of the office of Assemblyman Ed Chau, who eventually broke with his fellow Democrats and came out against the bill.

In late 2014, the group interviewed and endorsed four Republican candidates for the State Legislature who opposed affirmative action. It enlisted dozens of volunteers to campaign for them. All four candidates, none of them incumbents, won.

“They were a constant presence in my campaign office,” said Young Kim, a Republican who unseated an incumbent Democratic assemblywoman and is now running for Congress. “This was the first time that I knew that there were very active Chinese-American parents that were organizing this movement, specifically to fight against S.C.A. 5.”

Even after winning the fight in California, Mr. Li and other activists remain wary. Mr. Li said it was important to prevent Democrats in the California Legislature from gaining a supermajority that could allow them to pass a bill reinstating affirmative action. He said he was still worried about what the future held for his 13-year-old son, despite his strong academic performance.

“I think for him it’s going to be really, really tough if nothing is changed in current college admissions system policies and practice,” he said. “As an Asian male, it’s going to be very tough for him to get admitted to a top, elite school.”

His daughter is entering her senior year pursuing environmental studies at the University of California, Berkeley — a college Mr. Li said he did not think she would have gotten into if affirmative action had returned to California.

For many Chinese families, a focus on education is deeply rooted in the tradition they came from.

The civil service exam was a staple of Chinese governance for more than 1,000 years, leading to the rise of a gentry class of bureaucrats who supplanted aristocrats with inherited privileges. The test was a powerful engine of social mobility. The exam was abandoned in 1911, when the Qing imperial dynasty was overthrown.

Later, under Mao and during the massive upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, most schools were closed. When they reopened after the movement ended in 1976, it was clear just how much the country yearned for education. More than 11 million students flocked to take the college entrance exams over the next two years.

Chinese-Americans, most of whom voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, are split on whether to support affirmative action. Their support for it has fallen in recent years, from 78 percent in 2012 to 41 percent in 2016, according to the National Asian-American Survey. Among other Asian-Americans over that time, backing for affirmative action has remained consistent, at nearly three in four.

Alex T. Tom, the executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association in San Francisco, said that he supports affirmative action because he believes that Asian-Americans, like others, benefit from learning in diverse environments.

The son of a Chinese father and Taiwanese mother, Mr. Tom, 42, said he did not get into his two top college choices — the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles. But he did go to the University of California, San Diego, where he said he was exposed to racially diverse communities.

“There are benefits of living in a pluralistic society,” he said. “And there’s benefits that I gained from being able to have a suite mate who was black, and also someone who was Latino and white.”

And he said that while some Chinese immigrants may feel that they can overcome potential discrimination by having degrees from elite institutions, they would still face racism.

“You’re still, no matter what, seen as kind of like an other in this country,” he said.

One argument for affirmative action is that it would help correct for the harm done to generations of African-Americans who have faced systemic racism.

But a number of other Chinese-American activists said they believed that race-based admissions were one of the few things in the United States that represented true discrimination. Tony Xu, a member of the Silicon Valley Chinese Association, said he was not so sure about other allegations of racism.

“Inside people’s minds, maybe there’s something still there,” he said. “Systematically there’s no discrimination. I don’t believe that; I don’t feel that.”

Instead, activists said the slights they experience — whether it’s someone mocking their accent or the shape of their eyes — are limited to personal interactions.

“We never feel like this is something the whole society is doing,” Ms. Yang said. “You just more feel like this is just one person. We don’t really feel it is the system that created that discrimination.”

For some of the activists, their political work has led them to take up other issues. In Maryland, a sanctuary city measure proposed in 2017 failed after a Chinese activist group protested it. The law would have barred the use of state and local funds to aid federal immigration enforcement. The Chinese-Americans in opposition said that since they had followed this country’s immigration law and waited patiently for citizenship, others should, too.

The Orange Club is now focused on helping Republicans win in midterm races this fall. Orange County is host to a number of competitive House races, and the group is also supporting John Cox, the Republican candidate for governor of California.

In June, a post on an Orange Club page sought to rally volunteers to help in the final days of the congressional primary campaign of Bob Huff, a Republican and former state senator. The article asked followers to add their names to the post if they could help. Twenty-eight people signed up for what was ultimately an unsuccessful campaign.

“Let’s not forget that Bob Huff was alone fighting against S.C.A. 5 in the California Senate in 2014,” the post read, adding that it was time “to pay him back with tangible action. God helps those who help themselves. Helping Bob Huff is helping the Chinese people ourselves.”"

unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"I think it's interesting how everything is test based in certain countries with negative consequences and yet people oppose holistic admissions  
edit: apparently people disagree. i am going to make points rather than write coherent   
- i'd be curious how this argument would go in 1990s when colleges didn't have need based financial aid  
- this seems like this anti affirmative action attitude when in reference to ivy league schools when you could go to liberal arts colleges or out of state somehwere. obsession is only built on prestige  
- this seems to me like upper middle class dilemma. you're not rich like the kushner's and you can buy your way in or you're not getting into the appropriate feeder schools because you don't qualify. there are programs like prep for prep which can get you into a prep school if you're poor  
- the comparison to jewish people. sure similarities but although they were considered not part of mainstream in europe (ghettos, pogroms, holocaust). in america they probably assimilated because they did not look black and america has legally isolated african americans. but still anti semitism existed in admissions until i guess it didnt? i think there's clearly anti AAPI sentiment in admissions office
- admissions office are mostly white. why would you expect them to understand AAPIs?  
- ultimately ivies and other elite institutions could admit more AAPIs, but ultimately they want grads who bring prestige or donate money
- also i find this obsessions with certain schools is probably not good for mental health. i feel like AAPIs have difficulty with reaching out for help and this pressure to go to these schools. parents want people to be secure in a job, but seems like development of other skills is lacking. in america there are many to choose, but in other countries there is not  
- I'm filipino and growing up my parents wanted to have secure career. Dad wanted me to go into the Navy when I graduated or they even suggest being a postal worker (which is popular FilAm career) or even a priest. So there wasn't an emphasis to go to college, only if I wanted to. For me it seems like other SEAs of all sorts don't even graduate HS so they're not even in the conversation.   
- Also I feel like American universities and colleges are for acclimating white kids to PoCs.

We have a 20 year test case in what happens when you eliminate AA in california and white enrollment did not increase nor did any of the things being used to scaremonger Asians happen that are in this thread.

what often gets lost in the debate over prop 209 is that after initial drops in black and Latino enrollment their share is beginning to recover because ucla and Berkley are using socioeconomic admissions that benefit all races. The result is that ucla and Berkley are two of the most socioeconomically diverse elite schools in the entire country.

AA in its current form actually harms poor black and Latino candidates because racial diversity is more visible than socioeconomic diversity so schools will disproportionately give weight to race rather than wealth background to achieve ""diveristy"" goals. The end result is that the black and Latino students being accepted are disproportionately wealthy relative to the general population. This is in direct contrast to the very mission that AA was supposed to solve on top of it discriminating against Asians who themselves suffer from institutional racism.

AA does not work. It does not work for blacks. It does not work for latinos. And it does not work for Asians. There are better ways to increase black and Latino enrollment as the UCs have proven without discriminating against Asians and saying so is not ""bashing other minorities"" or against ""what we as a community stand for"".

This is true, but it's a different point than what OP is trying to say. 

 If Harvard loses the current Asian discrimination case, but not a (hypothetical) race-based AA case, then whites will lose out. Harvard won't cut into its URM percentages for obvious reasons, but will then struggle to fit both qualified white candidates + athletes and legacies.

If Harvard loses a (hypothetical) race-based AA case, the URM populations are going to lose out. A fundamental pillar of the race-based AA argument is that it's impossible to create the desired diversity using race-blind methods."

InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"One excerpt from the article that I think is especially relevant to much of the discussion on this sub:

> For Asian-Americans—the majority of whom support affirmative action—being cast in the foreground of the affirmative-action debate can be awkward and painful. Affirmative action has consistently been a “wedge” issue, and groups such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice have opposed attempts to use Asian students as the wedge in conservative attacks on affirmative action that may harm black and Latino students. Some simply deny that race-conscious admissions procedures are disadvantaging Asians at all, which avoids confronting a complicated dilemma.

Imho, it's not obvious that it's actually a ""majority,"" but I agree strongly with the last sentence. As I've written in other threads, I think it's important to recognize that the phenomenon is real before having an honest discussion about what, if anything, should be done about it.

Geography matters; Asian population growth is not uniform. And geography matters in admissions and manifests at different schools in different ways.

And whoever is fighting back is doing so because they believe that college admissions *are* important. Arguing about how college admissions are critically important for some people while simultaneously mocking others for obsessing over them is doublethink. It only works because the undertone is, ""Asians already have it so good, so why are they so whiny,"" which permeates Hassan's monologue.

Even the argument that, ""Oh, poor you, you got rejected from Harvard, so now you have to go to Cornell,"" is unnecessarily insulting.

This is a horrible thing when you're only 5% of the population.

Dividing up our 5% is going to get us nothing. The entire reason there's a concept of ""Asian American"" in politics is so that we can have a voice. More votes = more power.

However, what I don't understand is how AA achieves that for them.  If the AA-selected kids are actually more well-rounded than the Asian Americans, there really is no contest.  I do agree that test scores and grades aren't the end all, be all when it comes to evaluating an applicant.  But I'm not seeing the data that suggests this is the case.  I'm also of the opinion that the Asian Americans who *are* well-rounded are still getting hurt in the admissions process despite expanding beyond the ""traditional applicant"".  The policy that Harvard is instituting is simply seeking out diversity for the sake of diversity.

I don't think any Asian American would argue against a more correct implementation of Affirmative action in which like 8/10 ""converted seats"" are from whites and 2/10 are from Asians instead of what we have now where it's like 9/10 seats lost are Asian and 1/10 is white. 

Whites benefit from White privilege, geographic diversity (you gotta take kids from the Midwest and chances are they're gonna be white), from not being seen as monolithic, and from over-representation in legacy pools.

>we're individualistic and divided about them as anyone else

We can't afford to be due to our small numbers. Whites can be SJWs, liberals, radical far right Nazis, and everything in between simply because they are by far the largest majority. Policy benefits them solely due to the fact that they are in the majority. We fall through the cracks in this country, just as we fall through the cracks in affirmative action.

>In that way, I'd rather not be patronized and insulted, and rather be treated as an individual voter.

You'll never be white. I'm sorry. That's not how it works. You're only an individual if you're white. You will be seen first and foremost as ASIAN before any political leanings, ideologies, or personality. That's the cost of being a tiny minority."
virtu333,,"Not all asian applicants are the same, obviously. But there's a significant demographic (the dominant one among elite schools) that are quite homogenous.

What does it mean to be well rounded? You bring up William Cheng, but the devil's in the details. He get a couple brownie points for participation, but unless he's good enough so that he can run XC for Harvard or play in their jazz or marching bands, then the only thing of particular interest there is slam poetry.

Would you call Jeremy Lin well rounded? He has straight As and was a D1 level basketball player (and now we know, an NBA level palyer). Every single Ivy would snap him up in an instant, even if other D1 schools would only let him walk on or not recruit him.

Someone who wins Intel STS doesn't need to be well rounded. A USAMO winner doesn't need to be. The plain well rounded students (captain of X team, plays X instrument, X leadership position) is still a dime a dozen relative to the selection rates of elite schools.

At a certain point, the need to build a class with so many layers (academic diversity, activity diversity, socioeconomic diversity, and yes, some racial diversity) makes it hard to tell how much is raw discrimination against asians.

I think the asian numbers in MIT vs Harvard sheds a bit of light. MIT is 30%, Harvard is 20%, but when you throw in the fact that MIT is a STEM focused school, with also a smaller focus on high level athletes, it makes some sense that they can end up accepting asians at a higher rate."
virtu333,,"Addressing two again....seriously, when you're in the local ""prestigious"" youth orchestra and all but 2 of your 23 fellow violinists are asian, you'd have to be in denial to think something isn't up with that.

As people we are all our own unique individuals, but in terms of our ""niche"" role in what is essentially the competitive marketplace that is college admissions, the profiles end up quite similar (great violinist with straight As, pursuing medicine or engineering or what not).

I'm not encouraging the stereotype, but merely pointing out it's, frankly, quite real among elite asian applications.

If anything, I desperately want to tell asian parents to go fuck themselves when they try to force their kids into paths they ignorantly think will lead to wild success. No. We should follow our passions or be trying to find our passions, and follow those to our success."
virtu333,,"One: Depends on how you define ""well rounded."" At this point in the admissions game, being well rounded for the sake of it is not much in terms of value by itself. You don't get brownie points for participating in activities; depth and achievement at a high level are what is valuable at this point. A D1 level athlete who gets straight As or someone who can win national writing competitions and still ace her math classes; are these well rounded people? Or are we talking about someone who is straight As, class president, captain of a tennis team, and a volunteer organizer?

Definitions are messy, achievements aren't.

Two: I'm not encouraging the ""stereotype"" I am merely pointing out my observations coming from a large asian american community that essentially breeds their kids into elite students. 

Three: The Jewish case yes. The Asian one is a slightly tougher call; there are so many people who are academically qualified (superior students are difficult to distinguish except in specified cases). There is certainly a bit of it, but it's hard to isolate it specifically to one variable when there are others around.

I think the asian numbers in MIT vs Harvard sheds a bit of light. MIT is 30%, Harvard is 20%, but when you throw in the fact that MIT is a STEM focused school, with also a smaller focus on high level athletes, it makes some sense that they can end up accepting asians at a higher rate."
virtu333,,"One: Depends on how you define ""well rounded."" At this point in the admissions game, being well rounded for the sake of it is not much in terms of value by itself. You don't get brownie points for participating in activities; depth and achievement at a high level are what is valuable at this point. A D1 level athlete who gets straight As or someone who can win national writing competitions and still ace her math classes; are these well rounded people? Or are we talking about someone who is straight As, class president, captain of a tennis team, and a volunteer organizer?

Definitions are messy, achievements aren't.

Two: I'm not encouraging the ""stereotype"" I am merely pointing out my observations coming from a large asian american community that essentially breeds their kids into elite students. 

Three: The Jewish case yes. The Asian one is a slightly tougher call; there are so many people who are academically qualified (superior students are difficult to distinguish except in specified cases). There is certainly a bit of it, but it's hard to isolate it specifically to one variable when there are others around."
virtu333,,"It isn't just captains of industry though. Look at wiki's list of famous Harvard alums and how [diverse it is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harvard_University_people)

Yes, lots of business, science, law, and politics. But also Pulitzer prize winners, musicians, actors/actresses, etc.

Holistic admissions isn't just about AA. It's also about academic diversity (not just having a STEM focus like MIT) and diversity in terms of what people do (athletes, dancers, writers, etc.). Yes there are asians who do these things, but because it's a relatively smaller pool (or it's just not a focused activity), making for proportionally a smaller amount of exceptional standouts.

One issue with the whole ""well rounded"" debate is what the hell it means. As I mention elsewhere, is someone like Jeremy Lin, a straight A student and D1 student, well rounded? Or is well rounded used in reference to the straight A student who is X leader and Y musician and Z high school varsity athlete? 

The application pool is so huge that ""traditional applicant"" encompasses just about everyone who isn't truly exceptional....and guess where those people go?

Diversity is important, there is no doubt about it. 4 years of spending time and being exposed to people with different backgrounds and perspectives is incredibly important. I've met conservatives coming into school against gay marriage only to leave with LGBT best friends and a new open mind. A lot of people come from extremely white, wealthy communities, and it becomes the first time they can meet and interact with people different from them. So there's no use for bashing diversity either."

,,">But there's a significant demographic (the dominant one among elite schools) that are quite homogenous.

Do you have any proof of this (besides anecdotes from self-interested parties within the admissions process itself)?

What we do know are that Asians require higher test scores and that ""soft factors"" have historically been used to discriminate against supposedly undesirable demographics. There is ample evidence that many admissions people view Asians as falling into this undesirable demographic (i.e. ""Textureless math grind"").  Statistical evidence also strongly suggests the existence of racial quotas (http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/12/19/fears-of-an-asian-quota-in-the-ivy-league/statistics-indicate-an-ivy-league-asian-quota). 

The burden is then on you to prove that all these Asian students getting rejected are indeed somehow all the same."
ipiranga,,"> I do consider diversity itself to be an ultimately important goal

But how do you define diversity? Why is 70% whites OK but 70% Asians not? Because the white mainstream tells us so?
Those 70% whites are more monolithic than Asians because they're at least 5th generation Americans I'd say. They have no cultural heritage from whatever European country their ancestors immigrated from. Meanwhile, in 2015  most college-age Asian Americans are 2nd generation with ties to a wide variety of cultures: Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Vietnamese that are all distinct. So culturally, 70% Asians would be more diverse than 70% Whites.


If diversity: melanin content or ethnicity, again I'd say 70% Asians that are shades of white all the way to dark brown and vary from Aryan-Dravidian to Japanese to Indonesians are more diverse.


Intellectual diversity: Asians are stereotyped as STEM-loving. Not a big surprise considering the massive glass ceilings we face in business, politics, and law not to mention even in the arts. Read Junot Diaz (Oscar Wao) talk about how POC voices are marginalized in MFA programs.
However, I sincerely doubt Asians are monolithically STEM loving and there must be data on this. I will look into it because (anecdotes are shitty but) I definitely knew many humanities/arts interested Asians.


----------------------
And university representation hewing to national demographics is a separate issue that is also somewhat overstated.

1st, you're competing with people in your region/area. So already the national demographics are represented. Asians in California compete with Asians in California. You'll definitely get Whites from California but also get Whites from the Midwest and very very few Asians from the Midwest. If you read what students from Stanford and other elite colleges posted about their admissions reports (FERPA loophole allowed them to see what adm officers wrote about them) you'll see incontrovertible evidence that school districts and regions play a role in admissions. We already knew this based on what people said but there's paper proof now.

2nd, elite schools and even lesser schools now draw from a world population. There are upwards of 10% internationals at the Ivies and that number is most likely increasing. Apparently there's been an explosion of international students at other schools now as well. 
In the world population, whites are the clear minority at ~18%. 


So if you want your university population to match actual applicant pool demographics (IE the world!) you definitely should not have 70-80% whites. Even if you're gonna weight by a 10% intl quota (which doesn't even exist at any(?)/many(?) schools there should be fewer than 70-80% whites.

We're all branded as the monolithic ""Asian American"" moniker, so policy affects us the same way. Thus, we don't have the luxury of being splintered as a minority political force.

TBH, you're just going to glaze over whatever I'm writing anyway. Once again, you can choose to not believe it, but whites don't see you as an individual. They see you as part of the monolithic group of ""Asian Americans"". The cross race effect can't be overcome, at least in this generation."
virtu333,,"First of all, Caltech is a poor comparator. It is a small, STEM focused tech school, and is extremely different from the Ivies in many ways (poor athletics just as an example). I'd be interested in comparing MIT to Cal Tech too (MIT is 30% vs Caltech's 40% or so, interestingly enough). Caltech's goals in terms of shaping its classes and what it wants from its alums are extremely different than a Harvard or a Yale.

The article you bring shows trends, but it isn't a rigorous statistical analysis. There are so many factors in play that can't be accounted for, and one of the ones I really suspect is the academic/activity diversity (hence, why I bring up MIT). Caltech's difference as a school is a huge, huge factor. 

Now, as for the other issues:

Go take a look at Harvard's some Harvard [violin](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hro/roster) [sections](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~bachsoc/about.html) and then compare that to Harvard sports rosters and tell me there isn't something up. 60% and 50% of the violinists in the orchestra and chamber orchestra rosters are violinists. This isn't even looking at say, cello sections. You can even look at the complete lack of any asian brass players to see it at a smaller level.

When you consider how good these violinists are, you must also consider the even larger pool that competed to get in. If that's your ""niche"" in terms of application, well, you have a ton of competition now. 

Meanwhile, I barely saw any asians on the sports rosters. Something like 2 on the tennis team out of like 20 or so.

Although the defining of someone as a ""textureless math grind"" is problematic, I already mentioned the issue of so many asians wanting to pursue STEM and econ. I don't have my graduation brochure thing anymore, but you walk into a liberal arts classroom versus a econ or bio class, you look at the last names of each department in that brochure, and again you very clearly see what large numbers of asians are pursuing.

When so many people are squeezing into the same competitive areas, you create artificial competition.

Again, a huge issue is that Harvard only needs so many violinists and so many STEM majors.

That's why I bring up the MIT vs. Harvard numbers. MIT has a higher asian percentage, but it is also a more STEM focused school and has less of a focus on athletes, which could explain why more asians are accepted.

As for the textureless math grind issue...why accept someone that comes across that way, when you can easily find fine math students who seem more diverse in activities? And there are plenty of asians who are bright math students that don't come across that way. Unless you're talking USAMO level mathematicians (in which case they're pretty much a shoo-in), there are plenty of bright math students to be selective about it. 

Someone with straight As and a 2200+, and nothing else, is going to get into a good school but unlikely to get into a great one. There are so many students like this.

Throw in some ""well rounded"" extracurricular activities and it'll help, but there are still so many students here that schools can pick and choose as they please.

Now, add a dash of national achievement or some other kind high level success; now you're talking.

Competition now is so much more fierce that most good students are nothing but a commodity that need to differentiate themselves."
,,"> Really? If you don't have any sense of care about our self-interests, why are you even here in a sub about social justice for Asian Americans?

Asians lack that in the political theatre. What political issues we face, we are very divided on. At that point, what are trying to achieve? Any attempt to politically unite Asians must by its very nature either be so persuasive as to unite us all (which I don't see happening) or more likely silence whatever voices that you don't agree with.

Again, where's your proof? So far, all you've been doing is spouting off the Ivy League company line about wanting diversity, which is undercut by the fact that (A) lower income students are vastly underrepresented still and (B) these schools seem to have little problem sending a huge chunk of their wonderfully eclectic class into Wall Street or TFA, which are basically the same thing TBH."

Plenty of problems. AA for example, institutionalized discrimination against Asians.

Bamboo ceiling is well documented. Career progression halts at a certain point and Asians find themselves being shunted into dead end positions. Racism in the workplace in general due to damaging stereotypes.

A growing division in the AA community, particularly between the sexes. Lots of self hatred within young Asian American demographics. Lowest self esteem as a race, most bullied, least positive media representation, etc. It's all related. High rates of mental disorders particularly among Asian American females.

I'd love it if we were strong enough to stand on our own feet and have intense discourse over differing views and opinions. But with that ideal, you're putting the cart before the horse. Asians have been here for over 150 years and we still don't have decent representation. Mainstream Americans see us as a stereotype before individuals. We lack soft power. The narratives of other minorities are trumpeted every day on national television, news, and media outlets. Everyone is led to believe that Asians are just fine since they're doing well on exams. That can't be further from the truth.

Our community is fragmented, we are isolated as a demographic, and thus we incur the costs of becoming marginalized. Low political capital leads to marginalization by default.

Please don't tell me that these issues don't exist, like the rest of America does. It's gaslighting on the level of an entire demographic. Asians who go out into the limelight, adopt leftist agendas, and claim that we aren't facing ANY issues aren't doing us any good and setting us back decades."
virtu333,,"First of all, there's a burden of proof on your side as well. As I already mentioned,  your NYTimes article is poor analysis, and the SAT score issue could have underlying factors. The lack of transparent data to do truly rigorous analysis makes it difficult to come to a firm conclusion. 

I'm not arguing Asians are deficient in categories, what I'm saying is they are underrepresented in some categories and overcrowding others in what is essentially a competitive marketplace. 

My speculation regarding violinists and the STEM focus is that by disproportionately pursuing such things, artificial competition is created, making it more challenging to be admitted. As I have repeated many times, a school only needs so many STEM majors and violinists.

This is also why I bring up the MIT vs. Harvard issue, and is related to the issue with the Caltech comparison you bring up in the NYTimes.

Also just because lower income diversity isn't a huge thing doesn't exclude others factors. As for Wall Street issue, maybe even more people would go on to do finance and consulting if they didn't try to be more diverse in their selection process.

You haven't really offered any new insight with your lines of thinking.

Your comparison of TFA vs WS makes me wonder what your history is because it's so nuts. I have plenty of friends doing both, and the different worlds they live is astounding.

It's either affirmative action exists and Asian enrollment goes down because we're already over-weight by our population and even make-up of the schools.

Your proof in this claim is some anecdotal story about Harvard's orchestra. You really have no idea what the profiles of all these rejected Asian applicants are, and you're simply assuming that they're all a bunch of violin-playing pre-meds.

The only real data we have right now are supposedly heightened standards for Asian applicants via test scores. There are tonnes of rationalizations about why this is so, but the only actual facts that we have are that Asians have to score way higher than any other racial group to get admitted into the top colleges.

>Your comparison of TFA vs WS makes me wonder what your history is because it's so nuts. I have plenty of friends doing both, and the different worlds they live is astounding.

We are in *an abusive relationship* with the system, so we think it has to be either getting screwed by policy A or getting screwed by policy B.

> It's either affirmative action exists and Asian enrollment goes down because we're already over-weight by our population and even make-up of the schools.

How about an affirmative action policy that places us with equal footing competition with the whites? Currently they are still competing at an easier level than us.

Why would it be hard to identify a few race/demographics that are recognized as ""needing help"", and group everyone else exactly the same? The 2nd group will be competing on the exact same footing. How is this impossible?

If this version of affirmative action gets implemented, sure our enrollment goes down a little bit vs when there is none at all. But the number of spots freed up by Asians and whites for URMs will be proportional, instead of what happens currently, where almost every single spot given to the URMs comes from Asian spots and Whites are minimally effected.

((disclaimer: long, messy post ahead lol))

-one. Article brings up a great point that taking an anti-affirmative action stance also means you're letting more marginalized groups under the AAPI umbrella continue to suffer. However, I'm sure many people who are against affirmative action would settle for reworking the system so that *white* people are hurt more than Chinese/Korean/Japanese Americans, not removing it entirely. Like, that's the main issue. 

-two. Re: Asians needing to score higher on SAT.

>Indeed, Espenshade himself rejects the conclusion that his data are proof of racial discrimination against Asian American applicants.

I admit I don't really know anything about this guy, but I just looked him up on the Princeton faculty page. I hate pulling out the race card, but come on, he's an old white dude. Of course he doesn't want to admit that lol.

Also, it's been a while since the SAT has been graded on a 1600-scale. His findings could very well have been legit-- the reason for a smaller discrepancy today could simply be that other groups of people have collectively improved their scores now. As /u/chengg pointed out, Asians still need to score higher anyway, and I'm not sure why that gets waved off. 92 points (and 250) are a lot...

-three. This argument right here.
>Despite the fact that even the most conservative admittance numbers for AAPIs result in our community being represented on Ivy League campuses at rates three-fold greater than the size of our national population, AACE insists that our students are underrepresented relative to our applicant numbers.

So? If you're not for greater representation, I really can't see how you're not essentially employing the same logic used by people who shoot AAPI down when they ask for diversity in Hollywood. ""You're only 5% of the population! You're already overrepresented in the media!""

-four. I don't buy that a disadvantage you have that prevents you from scoring high on the SAT wouldn't inhibit you from getting a high GPA as well. At the end of the day, your GPA mostly depends on test scores. So, about that statistic where 100 SAT points only corresponding to 1/10 of a GPA point...What kinds of GPAs are we talking about here?

Brown and Harvard have insane grade inflation, so in those cases there wouldn't be much of a discrepancy. But what about schools that employ grade deflation? Or like-- what about GPAs for STEM kids (since STEM classes are usually curved)? I think this statistic needs dividing by school/major/etc. Comparing a STEM kid's GPA to a humanities kid's GPA just or a Brown kid's GPA to a Cornell kid's GPA just isn't fair."

The crux here may be related to the proportion of students that can fit as STEM. I think we can agree from our experiences that we uh, heavily lean STEM. Disproportionately so, in a similar way that we disproportionately make up say, violinists at top schools orchestras.

Notice how the Ivies range from 15-20% asian...then compare that to MIT. MIT has the same URM proportions as the Ivies (easiest to compare it to Harvard since they're right next to each other), but rather manages to get in around 30% asians. 

Where's that difference coming from? MIT is primarily a STEM school (like 97%+) instead of being half, while also not using legacy admissions and being a DIII school. Dartmouth and Brown also tend to lean lower in asian proportions than Cornell and Harvard and Columbia; some elite LACs like Williams and Amherst lean lower too IIRC."

ALittleFly,,"Because affirmative action isn't the problem - racist admissions decisions are. Why are you assuming that there are only Asians and blacks in the picture? Why are you pitting minority against minority? Why throw blacks and other historically/structurally disadvantaged minorities under the bus [including Southeast Asians] when there are also slots going to athletes and legacies (frequently white) who don't ""deserve"" it? 

Affirmative action is essential to prevent de facto racial segregation in higher education because higher education is essential not only in laying the groundwork for future professional networks, but in providing a potential forum for people to critically engage in discussions regarding race. Discussions about race rarely happen at any earlier part of education (and if they do, they're often shallow discussions), and given the self-segregation of people across information sources, the internet/media is not going to solve this issue either. And discussion/awareness is an important prerequisite to people taking constructive approaches to dealing with racial problems in our society.  "

Siantlark,Hole Poker,"I'm an immigrant. I came here in middle school (presumably around the same age as you). My mother is a RN just like yours. Unlike you, I spoke English well before coming here but other than that we have similar backgrounds if we're disregarding class background. 

Why are Asians the ones that ""actually made it""? Is this even a valid question to make when it's devoid of so much context? Let's take our cases. Our mothers both went to college and graduated with a degree. My father also went to college and graduated with a 4 year degree. 

That already creates an advantage. Parents with degrees often send their kids to college, and their kids are usually successful in gaining equivalent or higher levels of secondary education. University educated adults, immigrants or not, know the value of an education, and will plan for their kids' futures with that in mind. 

Just the education causes a massive gap. Why? Because it changes the environment you grow up in. Parents with degrees usually make more money than uneducated adults. They're more likely to have a smaller family which means they can spend more on each kid. They're going to be less likely to work multiple part time jobs. Their children are less likely to be forced to work to support the family. They will be more likely to live in a normal to nice neighbourhood. 

This is only going into the material differences that a college degree gives. 

The intangibles? 

Educated adults have higher expectations of their kids. They're more likely to instill a sense of social mobility than a kid that grows up poor. As immigrants our parents probably gave up a better life back home to move downwards; this downwards social mobility gives them an incentive to push their kids towards a ""better life."" Etc. etc. 

This is all motivation and physical resources that is not present for any kid growing up in the inner city. This is all without going into the systems of racial and ethnic oppression in the United States that further disadvantages minorities in physical, psychological, and sociological ways. 

""Asians"" made it in this country because the US immigration system favours highly educated, upper middle class Asian families with established ties in the US. They have degrees. They have avenues of employment. They have family or employers who vouch for them through the immigration process and ease them through naturalization. 

What happens when you remove that? What happens when we look at the Asians that fall through the cracks? 

Refugees from Southeast Asia do not ""make it."" They have those large dropout rates for black and Latino students. They have crushing levels of poverty. And they're currently in need of being admitted into the *exact* program that you want to abolish. 

Instead of whining about how it's unfair towards Asians and trying to abolish it, work towards increasing the effects of the law and undoing the injustice currently being carried out against our community because ""Asian"" is so large that it completely destroys any conversations about the education inequality in our community.

 If anything the ""racist"" policy you should be targeting is the legacy system which allows ""undeserving"" whites who have lower scores, lower GPA's and worse applications into schools merely because their father, and their grandfather, and their mother went to this school or that school. Those are the spots that are taking away from your precious admissions. Not the ones intended for minorities. "

madmanslitany,美國華人,"> ""Asians"" made it in this country because the US immigration system favours highly educated, upper middle class Asian families with established ties in the US.

I agree with your overall point that we shouldn't be fighting affirmative action. If anything, we should be fighting legacy admissions, the deployment of ""leadership"" qualities against Asian applicants by admissions boards in a repeat of the tactics used by anti-Semites earlier in the 20th century, and the aggregation of Asians into a bloc that robs Southeast Asians of needed opportunities through affirmative action.

That said, not to split hairs, but this particular narrative does bother me. It's not quite that simple. Chinese and Japanese families' fortunes started picking up before the wave of educated East Asian immigration from the 60s and 70s, and it was a combination of the efforts of the Asian community leaders here and the geopolitical needs of the US in East Asia that set the stage for the fortunes of Asian-Americans to improve. I actually think it's valuable to look at the perception of Chinese in particular during the era of the Chinese Exclusion Act, before that skilled immigration wave, to understand why we shouldn't necessarily be hostile to affirmative action--we were definitely NOT always the model minority, which is clear just looking at a typical early 20th century drawing of Chinatown by a white artist."

yah511,halo-halo,"I think it has to do with the age demographic.

Don't forget how few Asians there were in the US before the 70's due to immigration laws. There are very few Asian-American adults overall in the US in the 3+ generation category compared to 1.5 and 2nd generation.

Anything beyond 2 generations and they retain virtually no ties to their ancestor's homeland (except on St. Patrick's day when all the Irish people are suddenly REALLY proud). The strongest ties for European-Americans I can think of are Italian-Americans in the tri-state, but even their culture has taken on a decidedly American twist.

shittyrocks,,"While I agree with you that ""The Chinese who were subjected to the Chinese exclusion act are very different from the current middle class Chinese"", I don't believe it is a very small subset of Asians that are anti-AA. In the study that is cited by the article (http://aapidata.com/blog/aa-attitudes-affirmative-action/), the percentage of Asian Americans (not just Chinese Americans) that favor AA ranges from 64% to 36% based on how the question was asked.

Quote: ""Questions that refer to “increasing numbers” of black and minority students, rather than “increasing access to” higher education seem to negatively influence overall rates of support, as do questions that mention “considering race” rather than simply referring to “affirmative action.” ""

My take away (also my personal opinion) is that Asian Americans tend to support affirmative action when it is not based primarily on race. 

As I mentioned in an earlier post, I am sure the top 1% (or top 10% w/e floats your boat) of any race is in a better place than the bottom 50% of any other race in America. Social-Economic class needs to be the driver for AA and not race..."

subheight640,,"And the corporate world can easily argue that Asians are disadvantaged because our ""leadership qualities"" are simply lacking compared to other applicants, because we don't play enough team sports, because our culture simply does not mesh well with their culture, because we simply don't ""get"" their cultural values, because of language barriers, etc etc etc. 

Moreover, I think you completely miss the point of affirmative action. Colleges and businesses embrace affirmative action for the sole reason that **diversity in-of-itself has value over ""merit""**. A homogeneous, white-and-asian-only campus just isn't as interesting or exciting as a diverse, mixed race campus. Having homogeneous groups further drives more homogeneity - minorities tend not to apply to schools that lack racial diversity. Diversity drives the clash - and acceptance - of different cultures. If American history has taught us anything, it's that *race* is the most important fucking issue that America has ever faced, since the Civil War, since the 1960's Civil Rights era, since slavery, since forever. **Racism just doesn't disappear.** Tolerance and racial acceptance has to be *taught*, because tolerance is an ideology created to make sure Americans can get along with each other. Affirmative action forces people of different races to co-mingle and get along with each other, when the typical human being likes to hang out with his own race, in his own ghetto (ie, why the hell do you think this subreddit even exists????).

Americans have a vested interest in forcing people to get along, because when we don't get along life is even worse. That's why affirmative action is in place. So though diversity might hurt Asians a bit when it comes to college, it helps us when we go to the business world, where academics don't really matter as much anymore, where being ""likable"" is more important than being ""qualified"".

yes.


there was a recent editorial about an african american student who was the top performer at his high school. once he got into college, he found that the difficulty level was much higher than what he was used to and his performance and mood suffered. according to his professors and counselor, the rate at which he was adapting was shockingly slow.  

near as i could gather, basically, the poor guy was used to imitating what he thought was 'smart behavior' but he wasn't actually 'smart' or doing anything smart. it appears that he never actually learned how to think critically or do any serious academic work. it was all just an intuitive imitation of appearance and make believe. even by the end of the article, where his professors are claiming that his current work is showing some improvement, he is still clearly gliding by on hopes, emotions and 'positivity' rather than lean, cold, hard logic and strategy. it's really quite tragic when you consider that this guy was the **TOP PERFORMER** at his school.

something needs to be done about k-12 education. if we throw money at the problem, it can't just go to the management and it needs to come with some new standards.

this is true in the private sector. however, in the public sector, i have heard quite a few horror stories about some clearly unqualified persons gaining positions of authority which in hindsight, they clearly did not deserve. this includes some high ranking professors and management who shockingly lacked basic fundamental skills relevant to their post. things like: how to run a lab. or what a meniscus is. or how to write a lab report. or how to present their findings. some really, truly **BASIC** shit. but of course, they had innocent faces and seemingly strong records with numerous (and apparently meaningless) awards for achievement. 

there is some shady shit going on at the colleges. there is a significant culture of cheating among asians and people are starting to get wise to it, but not fast enough. there are few things that i hate more than incompetence and one thing that i know i hate more is if i'm paying for it.

there are lots of awesome asian professors -i'm really, truly not discriminating based on that- but if they lack BASIC SKILLS and BASIC KNOWLEDGE, i don't care how fucking platinum their tongue is or what kind of minority they are, they do not deserve to be in a position of authority.

My understanding of the exact procedures of AA in California, Michigan, or wherever else is not as detailed as I wish it was, stemming from the fact that I am Canadian and went to school here. But what I do support broadly is the idea of policies addressing the inequality of opportunity that different people have. For me, that would begin (but not stop) at socio-economic considerations."

tensegritydan,old school cool,"I dunno. I'm not an expert on institutional racism.

I was just clarifying the sociodemographic definition of the term.

But my uninformed opinion is, yes, white hispanics do suffer from institutional racism. If you are raised in a hispanic family/community, regardless of the relative color of your skin you may face language barriers, your name is likely to be identifiable as hispanic, you may live in a lower performing school district, you may be treated differently by law enforcement due to your community and friends, your immigration status may be a barrier to employment or education.

I do know a bit about race/ethnicity data. As I mentioned, hispanic ethnicity is orthogonal to race, so if you identify as hispanic ethnicity, you may identify as white, black, native american, unknown, or more than one of those. One of the better demographic terms for ""white"" hispanics is mestizo, which is the particular multiracial combination of Native/Indigenous American and Spanish-European who are much of the population of Mexico, Central America, South America. Some mestizo people have some black ancestry, but most do not. And even though mestizo people have indigenous american ancestry, many don't consider themselves Native American. So when asked their race, a lot of of Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans indicate ""white"".

So that is a long winded way of saying, yes, I think that Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Salvadorans, etc. face institutional racism, and many of them consider themselves to be ""white"".

EDIT-if you're wondering what this exchange was about, the commenter above questioned whether ""white hispanics"" are faced with institutional racism. But I think their comment was based on an inaccurate understanding of exactly what is meant by the term, so I cleared it up. And I guess they felt their comment was no longer relevant."

It doesn't go into hard-hitting topics like white people siding with police in almost every case of police killing, or the over-emphasis white people put on black on black crime.

When it comes to discrimination against Asians (or even blacks), white people are quick to point out, ""Hey, it's all in your head. Don't be over-sensitive and grow a thick skin. Facts >> Feels.""

Now suddenly, when the lens is reversed, and they are placed under scrutiny, it becomes, ""Why are we made to feel ashamed for what our ancestors did? Look at that Filipino director walking about making white people feel bad. Why are other races making us feel embarrassed and ashamed for something we haven't done?""

Yeah, because when discrimination facts are brought up with white people, suddenly ""Feels >> Reals"". Where is their thick skin now?

I watched the documentary. At no point of time does Jose say what a white person should ""feel"" about something, he just points out facts and and asks questions. Although I was expecting something cheesy and white-guiltish or outright aggressive like tumblr, at no point in the documentary does Jose hold white people accountable to anything.

It is the white people who themselves react on their own accord with either fear, guilt, or embarrassment. They feel out-of-element and out-of-place and standing on wobbly ground where anything they say might be used to judge them and stereotype them. THAT IS EXACTLY what it feels like being a minority and trying to ""fit in"" with the white crowd."

chaoser,1st gen,"I see backlash against affirmative action but how come I never see any backlash against legacy which mainly helps Caucasians? (In 2011 The Harvard Crimson found legacy acceptance rates into Harvard was 30%, [""more than four times the regular admission rate""](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/11/admissions-fitzsimmons-legacy-legacies/))

I agree that affirmative action is an imperfect solution to the problem of low black american acceptance rates into universities and I also agree that it hurts the admission chances of Asians; I'm sure it affected my acceptance into medical school even though I did get into one in the end. But even knowing those two things, I still think it is a necessary evil. Slavery existed for hundreds of years, the civil rights movement only came into full swing in the late 1940s with King and segregation wasn't torn down until 1954 in Brown v. Broad of Education. And it's not like everything was rainbows and sunshines after that.

African American attitudes toward education took a huge hit due to segregation and slavery. And then again following the introduction of crack to inter-city communities and the ""War on Drugs"". US drug and criminal policies continue to excessively target blacks and Hispanics over any other race. I know Attorney General Holder recently said minimal sentencing for non-violent drug crimes would be lowered but looking at the change 

>""Under current mandatory minimum guidelines, a drug offender convicted of possessing 500 grams of cocaine or 28 grams of crack would face a term of 63 to 78 months. Holder is proposing that the time in such a case be reduced to 51 to 63 months.""

and one can see that there is still a long way to go.

Those two things, as well as everything else that contributes to the plight of Black America created a street culture that praised Rims and gettin' hos over education. A culture where a majority of kids grow up without a father figure, living in unsafe neighborhoods, and [where doing well in school and working hard at a honest job instead of gettin' paid on the corners is looked down upon.](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/ebdb15aaf1/chappelle-show-wacarnolds) How are we suppose to blame the children that are born into this situation and then blame them again for not moving up in society? Shit's fucked up.

So how do you change this culture? Affirmative action offers one way. By allowing more black people into college, we create a culture that celebrates and appreciates education, which will in turn spreads that culture of education to their children. That's how we change that culture.

And so many people will say, hey, why don't we just make it based only on socioeconomic status? And yes, that would be the most ideal solution. But it only works in an ideal world where people of different races start off with the only difference being class. Kanye raps ""Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe"". Black americans were so screwed over by slavery, segregation, the War on Drugs, etc. that affirmative action truly needs to be focused on them because that is where the issue is, where we need to work to achieve racial justice.

Frank Wu, who I was lucky enough to meet and speak to back in college, states: “the crux of affirmative action is the use of race to respond to racial disparities” (Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White). In the book he talks about how Asian Americans and the ""model minority myth"" are used by whites to leverage power against other minorities with the end result being the exclusion of blacks from colleges and an excuse for white america to not fix the systemic disparity that exists. Finally he states:

""Affirmative action, in the end, is only a means. Opposition to affirmative action is not necessarily support for racism, but it can be. The appropriate response to opponents of affirmative action is the query, real rather than rhetorical, of how they might propose to achieve racial justice by other means.""

I think Affirmative Action has many wrong aspects to it and that in the end it is a flawed policy. But even flawed, it's still doing something necessary.

Isentrope,,"I'm not clear with how it works but, if SCA 5 supporters had originally wanted it to go to a vote in 2016, would they have been able to pass it in 2014 to do that?

lietk12,,"Something that I haven't seen in this conversation is the idea that race-based affirmative action can help certain historically underrepresented/disadvantaged groups of Asian Americans. As a student, I know that Stanford has been improving its diversity within the Asian Americans, in part because (for example) when only a few Vietnamese- and Pilipino-American students were admitted, they had felt isolated/alienated and successfully demanded that Stanford's admissions-diversity policy disaggregate Asian Americans. And many of my friends within those communities cite this line of reasoning as part of their support for affirmative action.

So I'm wondering:

1) When ""Asian-American backlash"" or opposition to affirmative action (or ""Asian American voters"", more generally) is reported, does that reflect backlash from all subgroups, or only from the most visible (and perhaps less underrepresented) ones?

2) Is there a reason I'm missing that this disaggregation-among-Asian-Americans-to-account-for-educational-disparities argument for affirmative action isn't mentioned in this discussion here?

3) Given that our subreddit says ""anything related to Asian Americans (and Pacific Islanders)"", when statistics are cited about the numbers of Asian American students with/without affirmative action, do the numbers cited also take into consideration the change in opportunities available to students who identify as pacific islanders?"

two,,">I see backlash against affirmative action but how come I never see any backlash against legacy which mainly helps Caucasians?

For the most part, because legacy is not statutorily mandated. I don't think anyone except those few who benefit from it is fond of legacy. Also, while it may or may not have a disparate impact, legacy is not in any way race-based. So it's subject to far less scrutiny.

As for the backlash, it is from Asian Americans who stand to lose slots from schools like UCLA or Cal. Maybe it's themselves, or a family member. This is a conservative mindset, and I don't mean that as a compliment. Before anyone yells at me about this—I've actually read and thought over the typical purported ""reasons"" against SCA 5, but they are all intellectually stunted arguments varying over a handful of wrong assumptions. I happen to have had a very privileged formal education, and to me the wrongness/wrongheadedness of these stated rationales are plain as day.

However. There is one exception, which goes back to the idea of robustness. The reason SCA 5 is problematic is that whoever is leading it did not do a good job of motivating it *for those who would be negatively impacted by the policy change*. Politics done well is a collaborative process, and not accounting for the voices and concerns of these backlash Asian Americans is a clear symptom of something lacking.

chaoser,1st gen,"I think it's easy to talk rhetorically about improving education/academic performance at the lower levels and extremely hard to actually do. We can't even do universal healthcare right, how would we viably get all the hundreds of moving parts involved in education to work correctly to ""fix"" the system?

I look at inner city school systems and I see a bunch of money being thrown at a problem that isn't solving anything. I see individual teachers trying to do good and being crushed by the institution. Until there's a legitimate replacement for affirmative action, I don't see how repealing it would help. Let's say we repeal it...ok, when are we going to get the ""real replacement"". That answer is never, it will be repealed and education at the lower levels would not be fixed or given thought. Why help the blacks? we got ours.

California hasn't had AA since 1996. Has there been any movement in terms of changing the lower levels of education for the better? Are African Americans doing better in school? The answer is no. No one cares about them, it's not on anyone's mind. More crime? lock 'em up. More drugs? Increase minimal sentencing."

I would not characterize this backlash like a mob any more than I would characterize the Civil Rights movement or Chavez' workers' rights movement as simply a backlash like a mob.  Action exists in dichotomy to an undesired status quo.  SCA 5 could be the proverbial awakening of a major force in the American political landscape.

calf,,"What are you talking about? *I* didn't do the demeaning; I was just describing their PoV of Asian Americans, because it has future implications. You have misread something. Anyways. Some comments:

1. My thesis is that the stopping of SCA 5 was not accomplished rationally. It happened because people complained, not because people actually gave good reasons against SCA 5 (you are welcome to disagree with me on this but I've tried to point out this problem elsewhere and people hate me now). Having something happen our way is not *progress*; far from it, what matters is what people on all sides have *learned* from the conflict. And my earlier comment was that this sent the a not very effective message—now the majority have the impression that Asian Americans are a fearful mob, etc.* This is the political nuance that has to be recognized by ourselves. That is what I mean by *intellectual*.

2. I don't care for the ideology exemplified by the superficially legitimate buzzphrases ""political backbone"", ""voting bloc"", ""major force in the landscape"". I reject this macho, realpolitik-esque model of political success, and certainly I'm not the only person. Strength is not a priori a virtue. I don't know what else to say here, maybe read more different books.

3. That was an incredible conflation of a *historical-scale movement* and *those instances within a movement that were marked by violence*. Remember that they weren't saints either: *we* need to be a little more open to self-criticism, not just because it will help us on the way but because it's a basically valuable thing to do.

*Just re-read the first line of the newspaper article. "
two,,"Sure. But with legacy, the disparate impact is so far removed from the *purpose* of the policy that it receives far less scrutiny, even if the policy does not promote a legitimate interest. Affirmative action, on the other hand, has exactly zero degrees of separation from race. It's openly race-based. Therefore, it is subject to close scrutiny, even if the policy promotes a compelling interest.

I mean, it's easy to see why legacy is not as substantial a social issue as affirmative action is. Legacy (1) is not endorsed by any legislation or other governmental policy anywhere; (2) is not race-based (i.e., discriminates on the basis of race - e.g., no blacks allowed); and (3) does not have a race-based purpose (i.e., does not discriminate on the basis of race, but is nonetheless engineered to produce racial discrimination - e.g., no residents of [predominantly Black neighborhood] allowed [*because* it is predominantly Black]).

The articulated rationale has nothing to do with race. There are no thinly-or-thickly-veiled race-based motives behind the policy. At worst, there is an *unintended* disparate impact. That's still bad, but it is nonetheless easy to see why it is not worthy of any measure of attention remotely commensurate with that of affirmative action."
chaoser,1st gen,"I agree that we should be pressuring our elected officials to make progress in educational inequalities. But while we talk and debate this issue, people are being disadvantaged. Being academic and talking about issues but ultimately doing nothing doesn't help. Once again, it's easy to talk about this but to actually act will probably never happen. Why work on fixing something that doesn't affect you? There will never be a major Asian American community coming out to march for better education reform because it does not affect them. AA was stopped with Prop 209, as far as Asians are concerned, they got their victory. Those other minorities? they can go win on their own.

I'd rather move ""backwards"" than lie to myself that there will ever be meaningful change and sit in the same spot talking about ""making progress"" while doing nothing about it. I say put AA back and when there IS meaningful change, to repeal AA. It's a band-aid but i'd rather have a band-aid while waiting around for some gauze than bleeding to death while waiting for some help."

You need to have people of your own community to change the community, nothing from the outside is going to because the outside don't give a shit. 

People (by which I mean mostly white people) always complain about ""black culture"", even though that black culture was created as a direct result of the actions of white people. So this is the way to slowly but surely change that culture."
Isentrope,,"I actually have tried to engage this subreddit in discussions about SCA 5, but it did not appear as though anyone was interested in discussing the issue in depth.  Based on a cursory glance at the pro-SCA 5 arguments, it was not immediately apparent that the argument could stand on its own without invoking some sort of reverence for the institution of diversity for the sake of diversity, something which I categorically reject as intellectually weak in the same way that you appear to be viewing anti-SCA5 arguments.

The message that this sends will vary and depends on message control.  I will again point out that opposing race as a consideration in college admissions has [broad support](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163655/reject-considering-race-college-admissions.aspx) among the general population, and so the onus should definitely be on the pro-SCA5 crowd to articulate an effective message.  I've followed politics for close to 10 years now, and I don't see how this will palpably affect how others perceive Asian Americans, but it should be viewed as a net positive no matter what side of the issue you are on, in that it reignites the meaningful debate over affirmative action policies that is necessary to bridge consensus and effect a vision for a more racially balanced society.  

The antecedent to political success is the ability for a bloc of voters to share a common interest that is therefore better expressed as a whole in the electorate.  I don't mind if you don't share my enthusiasm for the game of politics, but buzzphrases like the ones I have used reflect an actual problem with Asian American politics, and I don't think we disagree on the issue of lagging Asian American participation in the democratic process.  The fundamental premise of diversity in any context is the pursuit of varying viewpoints in order to generate a well-rounded perspective on a topic of interest; this is the context from which I view Asian American participation.

Discussing the various Civil Rights movements is an important background from which to describe a similar awakening in the Asian American community.  The fundamentals of these movements are very much analogous to what has happened with the SCA 5 debate, and are what ultimately spurred the national dialogue to better relate to the interests and needs of these minority communities.  There is, perhaps, a sense of unease with liberals, who tend to see minority activism as furthering a progressive vision, since the SCA5 movement is largely reactionary, but it is nevertheless an important nuance in the storied history of civil rights in this country.  This should not be seen as a move towards regression, but a path forward that charts the future of race relations in a way that fundamentally alters how liberals treat the topic of race.  Just as how you are calling for Asian Americans to have a measure of self-criticism, I find a compelling need for the same by backers of measures such as SCA5, who premise their argument on facts which may or may not reflect current realities.  Critical examination of support for some of these positions can only lead us to craft more robust and carefully tailored responses to the real problems which face Asian Americans, and minorities in general, in this country."

Affirmative Action is almost always discussed as a race thing. Despite decades of Affirmative Action policies blacks and Hispanics are still very under-represented on college campuses.

White women. 

Nobody wants to discuss it because of the fear of being called sexist but it's true. White women have seen the most gains in college and the job market from AA policies. When we're mature enough to address this, we can discuss AA. Until then, fuck it, I don't care because any discussion of AA along the racial lines is intellectually dishonest if you don't include gender into the mix."

schadkehnfreude,,"non-Californian so I can't comment on UC's particulars, but I do remember a friend telling me that for public universities in Michigan there are several points that each applicant gets when being considered for admission - and one area where you could earn points was being a traditionally disadvantaged minority, until the 2003 Gratz. vs. Bollinger case where it was ruled unconstitutional.  However, another opportunity for earning points was 'legacy status', i.e. being the child of an alumni.  There's no explicit racial aspect but statistically speaking a legacy applicant is overwhelmingly likely to be an upper-middle class kid from a white family.  And even if you didn't have that point system, it's no secret that being a legacy or child of a mega-donor carries huge weight in the admissions process.

So, even if its ham-handed at best, you can't just blankly remove affirmative action considerations from the process and truly expect it to be race-blind."

The model minority myth is a doozy that manages to both benefit and marginalize AAs. But Black people and LatinXs don't have that at all.

From one minority to another, yes, we all face our own forms of marginalization and AAs certainly do experience racism. The real kind. But you all don't face the wrath of being the most hated race in America. You don't face the consequences of anti-blackness as soon as you're born.

lurker6412,California,"I use to be against it but now I support it because I believe it gives other under represented minorities, with less opportunity and community resources, a better chance to attend a university. Opposition to affirmative action will say that less qualified people are being accepted to universities on basis of race rather performance. My response is that they're usually ignoring the privilege and resources they've had that many under represented minorities didn't have. This is a result of institutionalized racism, and the only way to fight against it is to have more under represented minorities succeed academically. Also, I view affirmative action as not competing against people of other races, but rather they are competing against people within their race. For example, it would be unfair to compare a white, middle class applicant to a working class latino or African American, because the middle class applicant would have more resources (income, community resources, private resources, extra curriculars, etc.). 

If you're the white, middle class applicant and you didn't get admitted, it's not because the Latino took your place, it's because you didn't compare well against other middle class, white applicants."

1. It does reduce the rates of Asian Americans, who are by all objective measures, superior students to all others. For some reason, white rates do not change whether or not an Affirmative Action program exists. 

2. Point #1 is true largely because of stereotypes about Asian students. Bookish, nerdy, anti-social, not well-rounded, not leadership material. It's kind of baked into the system as it is right now. 

3. It's far too late. Affirmative Action should be taking place at the elementary school level and beyond. Minorities that receive the Affirmative Action boost drop out at higher rates. And why wouldn't they? They've gone to inferior schools and had an inferior education and inferior opportunity their whole lives, you dump them in a *university* environment and expect them to keep up after 18 years of being held back? Some of them need serious remedial help to even get to the starting line, much less be able to take college level classes. 

As an *idea* though, I like Affirmative Action. You can't deny the real effects of systematic racism in our society. It's an attempt to remedy those. And one of the best ways to remedy racism is to integrate people. But the current system is pretty hamfisted and haphazardly put together. It can definitely be done better.

I think the best example of that is the fact that the people who benefit most from Affirmative Action aren't even people of color. It's white women. Seems a bit messed up if the purpose is to bring some balance to the racial demographics."

A negative adjustment on groups of people who have managed to perform well *despite* adversity is hardly fair. That said, I do support race-based AA because the reality is that race-based discrimination is still alive today. People love misrepresenting Martin Luther King as somebody who advocated colorblindness, so let me put one of his quotes out there: ""A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for the Negro"". 

Even if there weren't AA, it's highly likely colleges and universities would find some way to avoid an ""overrepresentation"" of Asians, by shifting the goalposts for admissions, much like how they did for Jewish people earlier last century. You may think not allowing this to pass will somehow help Asians, but I doubt it.

I really really agree! I am late to the thread, but next time this came up, you can present this (just copying and pasting one of my comments).

> Well, being Asians shouldn't give us a harder time of getting into college than being white. They could easily set affirmative action such that if you do not qualify as any of the underrepresented minorities, you are treated as a default case.

The fact of the matter is that, if it does come down to a vote, Asian Americans will be penalized for performing well in school.

UCSD's AA graduation rate *doubled* after it stopped using quotas.  These people that were getting in because of considerations to race were wholly unprepared to handle the coursework, and it was reflected in statistics like this.  Going to college was a waste of their time and the state's money, and as much as we seem to pride ourselves in trying to find the ""diamonds in the rough"" who benefit from affirmative action, we can do that without instituting such policies.  

Ultimately, if you want affirmative action to be a measure, I want to know *exactly* how you quantify this ""anti-blackness"" in terms of points, because the measure being introduced is simply giving too much leeway to school admissions officers, who are under heavy pressure to admit more URMs.  Without this, we are never going to advance beyond the current situation, which further disadvantages URMs when it turns out that being able to go to college is not, in fact, a golden ticket out of the circumstances."

Studies using observational data on comparable groups of minority students in STEM fields have shown that affirmative action admits end up doing worse at the more rigorous institution and thus are more likely to drop out of STEM.

The origins of the model minority is racist propaganda to oppose accusations of institutionalized racism during the Civil Rights era. It ignores the history of immigration of AAs and the US's history of exploitative demand from skilled laborers post WWII (depending on alliances we could have also been considered as the Yellow Peril). The model minority focuses on AA that had privilege and money to immigrate, and totally overshadows AA in poverty--these are people who are political refugees, undocumented immigrants, and legal permanent residents.  My colleagues and I have never benefited from the model minority myth. I can make the same argument that the stereotype that blacks of being exceptionally athletic and virile has benefited blacks, but we both know that's not true.

Not choosing people who are less qualified over those that are better qualified, but choosing the minority in the case of equal qualifications.

Education is still seen in many communities as something for the elite and the ""White thing"" to do. Most of these underrepresented groups don't really mobilize on this subject matter, prime example is the CA Prop 209 where [Latin@s and Asians voted against it but fairly close to the margin at 63% and 58% respectively and women opposing it 51% to 49%.](http://polmeth.wustl.edu/media/Paper/alvar98a.pdf?origin=publication_detail)

As I said, one of the biggest racial inequality is directly tied with class, which is that a lot of Blacks are stuck in a cycle of poverty, with no easy way out except education. 

When it comes to education opportunities, a black kid from a gang filled ghetto school, whose parents never graduated from high school, will have very different experience from a middle/upper class black kid from a well respected public or private school, who have highly educated parents at home to motivate and teach them. Yes, both will suffer discrimination and racism, but I imagine the experience and challenges will be fairly different.

So, in the end, you have:

AA based on race. It directly helps certain racial group, it benefits the haves and the have not of that racial group equally (even though the have nots segment requires more help in this area), that also allows legal racial discrimination against other racial groups.

Or

You can have AA based on income, which do not ignore class, it does not favor or discriminate one race directly, but it does indirectly favor segments of a racial group (ie, the poor blacks and Latinos) more.

Neither of two will solve every problem, but ask yourself which one brings more solidarity across racial lines, which one is more fair."

Furthermore, the score gap that Espenshade points out is so large that I think it's not unfair to derive from it a difference in how qualified someone is for college.

The rebuttal you linked describes affirmative action policies as 
>preferentially choosing the underrepresented minority student **when compared to a student of similar standing who is not underrepresented.**

The legal permission to discriminate based on race is the permission to place quotas on and systematically oppress Asian Americans (see history in the other posts regarding Jewish-Americans and the quotas they faced).

Yes, I am very much against always phrasing affirmative action as a tug of war between minorities. I feel like I have even said it too many times in this thread. But I am perfectly fine with it if both asians and white are make EQUAL sacrifice to help other communities of color. I feel the biggest unfairness come from asians getting a harder time than white people. The affirmative action as it is implemented now pits asians and other minorities against each other, but if asians and white people gets the same treatment, then I don't see it as pitting asians and other minorities against each other. We should argue to push for equal treatment between asians and white people under affirmative action, instead of argue on the false dichotomy of either affirmative action exist in the status quo form or don't exist at all.

> Many seem to push the narrative that education should be for those who ""earn"" it but in reality in its current state, 

I really agree with the fact that the cycle of poverty needs affirmative action to break it. However, I see it as a consequence of us being a minority with no political voice, such that we ended up taking most of the harm (much more than white people), even though affirmative action is suppose to repair the consequences of white oppression (which asians also suffered under).

> It may hurt some of us (which is why we also need to evaluate a way for our community to come to the table to reform AA with the other underrepresented groups, which is a topic for another day)

Why do we always push our own interest aside? Why shouldn't we be assertive and unapologetic about our legitimate space in society? We are willing to make sacrifices to help the greater society, but we just want equal treatment between those who make this sacrifice. This is not even asking much. Why is it so hard to give asians equal treatment as white people? Why should we feel hesitant to pursue our own self interest when we are very weak as a political group?"
BalboaBaggins,,"It's not fair to characterize a lack of affirmative action as ""shutting the door in their face."" 

I would add to my previous statement: Admission to a UC is definitely not a right. California has a three-tiered higher education system for a reason. Half the Cal States have an admission rate over 60%. If that's not an option, California has over 100 community colleges, most of which require only a high school diploma to enroll. Just about every one of those black or Hispanic kids who do get through high school can find a college that would take them.

I admire the system that the University of Texas uses for automatic admission. The UCs ought to do the same, perhaps with tiered percentages to ensure properly sized student bodies. For example, UC Berkeley and UCLA automatically admit the top 3% of California high school seniors, UCSD admits the top 5%, UC Irvine admits the top 8%, and so on with the rest of the UC's and then the Cal States.

Such a system would increase enrollment of underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities without admissions officers having to add race-based plus-factors to applicants."

This is pretty much racism right here.  You assume that every Asian student has had prep classes and thus they need to work harder to get in than any other group.  Why do they need to compete within themselves for admission when everyone else must meet a lower bar.  If they're showing the dedication to their academics, why penalize them for the color of their skin?

Look at your own writing and you'll see something is very, very wrong.  Every time you refer to non-Asian minorities, you assume socioeconomic disadvantage based on the color of their skin, whereas you stereotype Asians as successful without regard to their economic condition.  Nobody is arguing against income/class-based affirmative action, but why should an Asian kid whose parents are just as poor and goes to the same school as a non-Asian minority kid have a disadvantage.  Moreso, why should said disadvantage be to the tune of **140** SAT points per subject, nearly 1.5 standard deviations.  Please tell me how you justify that as an academic."

This paper seems to concentrate on whites vs unrepresented minorities, so AsAms related analysis is sidelined. Table 3 is interesting. However, maybe the non-change in Asian enrollment rates in public university is due to general trend of AsAms deciding that they don't need university education to start their life? Because in private 4-yr college, we declined the most in enrollment rate, even though private colleges are not affected by prop 209. So my argument is: we gain enrollment rate in UC and CSU systems, but it is offset by the general decline in our college enrollment rate. 

Table 10 is only about graduation rates, right? (1), (2), (3) are their metrics for graduation and/or utility of college education, not for admission/enrollment of colleges.

This is just my quick analysis of the situation, but it does make me wonder how much does prop 209 help us. If they did a change in rejection/acceptance rate, then it would be more clear on the effects of prop 209 on us.

You said it exactly.  Then who benefits from Affirmative Action in college admissions?  Upper-middle class non-Asian minorities.  So here you have a program that does not help those who need it most and in fact hurts a minority group (Asian Americans) by discriminating against them.

In your example, what's really important between the groups you're comparing?  Is it because they're Black/Latino, or because they're growing up economically disadvantaged?  What if an Asian kid grows up in that same inner-city neighborhood - should that kid have to get a 4.0 and a 1340 to be considered for college?  Or if a Black kid grows up in a nice suburb - should he get special treatment for being Black even when his family is making 200k a year?

Dimeron,,"As it has been repeatedly stated in previous comments, it is about preventing legalized discrimination.

Income based admission:

-Poor will have an advantage

-Black and Latino have the highest poverty rate and some of the lowest median family income, thus will gain the most benefit.

-Does not discriminate on racial line..


Race based AA as it has been practiced:

-Directly benefits a racial group, admission will ""try"" to match school representation to real world demography.

-A racial group is not always homogenous. A poor black kid from the ghettos will have very different education experience than a middle/upper class black kid from the suburbs.

-It ignores class, that means poor blacks and Latinos still have to compete with their richer counterparts and well educated African immigrants. Still at a disadvantage.

-And has been historically used to legalize Asian discrimination.

Neither solution solves all the issues. Race based AA is not ""better"", as it ignores economic inequality.

Now, why do I think a class based solution is better? because the concept of compromise and finding mutual beneficial middle ground. While I do think blacks and Hispanics need help, it should not come in a form legalized discrimination. 

Income based will also help large portions of Black and Latino community who needs it the most, it will face far less oppositions from Asians, it will also help the poverty stricken Asian groups that are often invisible.

Or push for the flawed AAction as it is today, completely ignore the fact it is legalized racism against Asian Americans. And then wonder why the discriminated group don't support a policy that discriminate against them.

I know for me, I don't like talking about topics like this without some proof from people who know far more than I on the subject. Anecdotal evidence really doesn't suffice for discussing topics that are so emotional to people.

My take of the lack of change on the enrollment rates is that overall acceptance totals are increasing so the rates of acceptance are keeping along the same lines, since the overall totals in acceptance in Table 3 has grown (whether or not to needing more students at public schools to offset budget cuts or not). I think since Prop 209 doesn't affect AA as much as it does for public schools, they still take race into consideration in the admissions process. 

From looking at the Espenshade study that is so often quoted in this discussion by others, it seems like their results about AsAms being at a disadvantage is because of Legacy preferences and recruited Athletic scholis, rather than straight out from the minority preferences.

You're right on table 10, but it also ties in to the lack of underrepresented communities being accepted causing fewer Black and Latin@ students on campus which leads to lower graduation rates specifically to those communities. There are many possible reasons for this, such as students of color transferring out, the lack of on campus resources or funding, and other issues underrepresented communities may face at universities. Stuff like this could also affect the rates of admission and even application by PoCs because Prop 209's impact.

Exactly to your point, we are so caught up on anecdotal evidence and narrow focused studies like Espenshade, that the larger picture of AA's effect on AsAms might be overstated. There are much more for us focus on advocating for AA and reform it to benefit us than to dismiss it all together."

No it's not a lie. Black and Latino families don't choose to live in areas with the worst schools, they live in the best place that's within their means, which ends up being where all the other black and Latino families live. White families who do have the means choose to live in their own separate communities - I don't see how you can change that without seriously infringing on the right to live where you want. This country tried busing minority kids and it failed miserably. There's a school like that in the next district over from where I went to high school. Thirty years ago, it was affluent and white. Poor black kids were bused to the school and all the white families fled to the suburbs or sent their kids to private school. The school wasn't integrated, it just went from rich and white to poor and black in the space of a generation. Similar results happened all over the country.

Great article about how Harvard has been trying to keep its admissions practices secret for years and how they've made deals with the government in order to be allowed to do so. Also interesting stuff about the information that *has* leaked out:

> The university had long claimed that preferences for recruited athletes and legacies served only as a tiebreaker between applicants with “substantially equal” qualifications. Officials had also claimed that applicants who are children of alumni tend, unsurprisingly, to have better test scores and other numerical ratings than others in the pool.

> But the data collected by the Education Department contained some explosive information. It showed the athletes and so-called legacies who were actually accepted had lower SAT scores than the rest of the class and were also deemed less attractive candidates by the admissions officers conducting Harvard’s process.

> Some of the comments those officers wrote on the application folders of admitted legacies strongly suggested something more than a tiebreaker was at work. “Lineage is main thing,” one reader wrote. “Double lineage, but lots of problems … no balance,” the notes on another successful application said. “Lots of lineage here … Hard to explain a NO,” yet another said. “Classical case that would be hard to explain to DAD.”

and

> Harvard documents made public after the investigation showed that applications were distributed to readers for various “dockets,” which are almost entirely geographical. However, a couple of the dockets were limited to certain private schools. One included 17 New England prep schools, like Choate, Deerfield Academy and Hotchkiss. The other docket served just two schools: Philips Academy in Andover and Philips Exeter.

> Although Harvard denies any numerical targets based on race, ethnicity or alumni status, the released documents make clear there were indeed “targets” for the various dockets. For the Class of 1992, Harvard sought to admit 2,040 applicants, 135 from the 17-prep-school list and 61 from the Andover and Exeter docket.

InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"People rightly criticize the advantages given to legacies and rich people, but I think that not nearly enough heat is placed on athletic recruitment (which this article briefly touches on). It's no secret that the students with the weakest academic credentials at Ivy League schools tend to be athletic recruits. Admissions based on athletics is completely stupid at a place like Harvard, where the quality of the sports teams has absolutely nothing to do with what makes the school good or desirable, either in an idealistic sense or in a practical sense.

I think the reason why people don't criticize it as much is that they incorrectly believe that at least it's fair to minorities and poor kids (or perhaps even tips in their favor), but this is wrong: These advantages again skew towards whiteness and privilege. (I believe Daniel Golden presents evidence for this argument in his book.)

From Alito's dissent in Fisher v. Texas:

>On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument. UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority minority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the University would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11– 345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit “[t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas”)

And he continues:

>Moreover, although UT reframes its argument, it continues to assert that it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities. For instance, UT’s brief highlights its interest in admitting “[t]he black student with high grades from Andover.” Brief for Respondents 33. Similarly, at oral argument, UT claimed that its “interests in the educational benefits of diversity would not be met if all of [the] minority students were . . . coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds.”"

The studies I've seen still show overwhelming support for race-based affirmative action among Asian Americans. [Take a look at Q16A in this survey published in September](https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/aavs2020_crosstab_national.html), which shows about 70% of Asian Americans support affirmative action while 16% oppose.

From what I can tell, a lot of the right-of-center Asian voters (especially a lot of the Republican Vietnamese Americans I know) are motivated by issues like taxes, fear of socialism, and outright hostility towards black people. Taking Affirmative Action off the table isn't going to persuade them.

The author of the linked article boldly purports to speak for all Asians as a single-minded group of voters, all with the same opinion:

> Asian-Americans, especially Chinese-Americans, hate race-based affirmative action in education that systematically discriminates against the admission of their children. 

> Chinese-Americans view these actions as an assault on their cultural values, with a firm belief in competition, individual accomplishments and meritocracy, that is distinctly conservative.  

> In addition to the Democratic Party’s push for affirmative action, Chinese-Americans are also wary of what they perceive as creeping communist ideas in the liberal left.

And you can believe that, while I'll personally disagree. I don't believe it's a significant factor, at least as compared to issues like legacy/donor admissions, systemic bias regarding soft factors in admissions (the types of extracurriculars that admissions officials like or don't like, intangibles like leadership and commitment to public service), and the significant difference in outcomes for Asians in the workforce as compared to similarly educated whites.

In other words, the bias against Asians primarily happens after they're already admitted, and long after they've graduated. Moving the students ""up"" a school or two in the rankings isn't going to address the elephant in the room, and what I think the focus should primarily be on."

InSearchOfGoodPun,DOES NOT FOLD,"Why should we be forced to choose between Harvard’s admissions model (which is set up to quietly stack the deck in favor of the privileged while they publicly tout affirmative action) and the Berkeley admissions model? The author values diversity, but can anyone explain how white people add more to a school’s diversity than Asian people? I still can’t figure that one out."
Stoxastic,,"It's always strange that these Harvard student/alum op-eds oppose the plaintiff but they all skirt the actual argument of the lawsuit. 

The lawsuit argues that Harvard admissions is discriminatory towards Asians. Harvard defends itself by saying that they do not discriminate.

However, instead of addressing and supporting Harvard's actual defense: that they do not discriminate, these op-eds talk about the merits of having a diverse student body and the other benefits of affirmative action.

Perhaps it's because at it's core, race based admissions is by definition a form of discrimination. But it's supporters believe that it's a price worth paying for student body diversity, with Asians paying most of that price.

Truly a fascinating lawsuit."

,,"I'm a Cal alum and I disagree that Berkeley should be more like Harvard. I would not want Berkeley to have legacy admits or admission preferences for children of faculty/staff members. The school **should** increase its number of African-American and Latino students though.  A lot of African-American students who are admitted to Cal decide to go to private schools (Ivy Leagues, Stanford or historical black colleges) instead since they offer more competitive financial aid packages. Cal needs to either 1. offer more competitive financial aid packages for under-represented minorities or 2. they need to admit more under-represented minorities (URM) in general so that people aren't turned off by going to Cal thinking that it's not welcoming to URM.

In which the main subject, Michael Wang says:

> Michael told me he recognizes the importance of racial diversity. “Being stuck on a [predominantly] white campus made me feel bad too,” he said, recalling his time at Williams. Yet both he and his father seem comfortable with the prospect of having fewer black and Latino students on campus — the likely outcome if race-based affirmative action were eliminated — if it means that Asian students benefit.

> “Are they really working hard like Asians?” Jeff posed. I asked him if the idea of a majority Asian American student body gave him pause. “What’s wrong with that?” he said.

> Ultimately, college admission is a zero-sum game, Michael said. As he put it, “Someone has to lose for someone else to win.”

""Someone has to lose for someone else to win."" Why do the losers have to be underrepresented students? Why can't the ""losers"" be rich, white legacy students who often get in simply because they were born into the right families? The idea that getting rid of affirmative action at the expense of other people of color is okay if it benefits some Asian Americans seems much like a ""fuck you, get mine"" mentality to me."

Phokus1983,,"> Why can't the ""losers"" be rich, white legacy students who often get in simply because they were born into the right families? 

Because none to few of the asian harvard students are making this argument because they want to have their kids to benefit from the same legacy system and reap the rewards of generational oligarchy like white folks do. There's an incentive for asian students to defend Harvard's discriminatory practice because they don't want to rock the boat and perhaps harvard decides that their children shouldn't reap the same rewards as well.

Basically the asian students that got in are making the argument of 'got mine, fuck you' to all the rest of the asians who didn't get in."
Stoxastic,,"Hey, I totally agree that Michael Wang and others in that article are unsavory individuals. I also agree that we should try out best to help underrepresented minorities. And I also agree that legacy admissions are bullshit.

As unsavory as those individuals put it, they do have a point in that college admissions is zero sum since there are limited spots. Look at this graph:

It's very hard to look at that and say that they aren't discriminating against Asians. 

I do think that helping underrepresented minorities is a good thing. I also believe that diversity on college campuses is a good thing. I think it is very unfortunate that those two things are in jeopardy of going away, but I definitely believe that Harvard is discriminating against Asians. 

I like affirmative action and agree with the author's take on the merits of having a diverse student body. However, I cannot in good conscience tell other Asian Americans that they should be the ones to ""step aside"" in order to achieve this goal."

Let me guess, because you don't see as many Asians at those causes, you think Asians don't care about anything else, not stopping to think maybe Asians do care about other causes, but, *GASP* Asians are only a tiny fraction of the population and they might get lost in the crowd of white people or other larger ethnicity!

Yeah, Asians never supported black people:

http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/10/22/philly.school.asian.american.attacks/index.html

Or what about rappers write songs glorifying committing crimes against asians.  Where was the national outrage? Or the recent black on asian vioence that's been happening in NYC?

Outrage is certainly not from wealthy liberal asians who think asians are privileged (even these poor 1st gen FOBs) and black folks get a pass because they're lower on the oppression scale.  The dirty little secret, of course, is that wealthy progressive 2nd/3rd/4th etc. gen asians look down on 1st gen asians.  There's never national outrage when asians face any sort of discrimination.

Asians are always asked to sacrifice themselves for the greater good and abuses against asians, whether from systemic racism from whites or from other minorities are ignored.  You're asking a group of people who have 0 political power or influence to sacrifice for others FIRST.

crayencour,,"I think you should also have continuing conversations with your boyfriend about the negative impact of these gender roles. It sounds like there is much about his family's traditional-mindedness that you appreciate (the sweet gestures and concern for your health), but other aspects that you find constricting and unnecessary (the requests to work on your appearance). 

The relationship is fundamentally between you and your boyfriend, and if your future in-law's actions are making you uncomfortable, then your partner should be able to (respectfully and appropriately) stand up for you. I also wonder to what extent your boyfriend agrees with the expectations coming from his mother (in terms of you dressing a certain way, contributing more to household chores, etc.). Maybe on a deeper level, he also hopes to see you dress nicer, etc., but won't press the issue. I think it's important to get clear with him on his own views around gender roles and expectations for his partner. 

And while I'm sure gender plays a role here, I would caution against interpreting all interactions exclusively through that lens. Many of us, male or female, gay or straight, would prefer a partner who presents well and helps around the house. There is individual variation, not just social conditioning around gender roles. So, as much as possible, I hope you and your boyfriend are able to have a conversation about expectations for each other that you each have as individuals, apart from gender roles."
sboml,,"A general note- I think sometimes Asian folks living in the West are too quick to assume that a family member's ""traditional"" values are a reflection of ""true"" culture and thus can't be challenged or discussed in any way. Asian countries, like Western countries, change and evolve over time, and have a wide range of people & personalities, regional attitudes, etc! Sometimes Asian immigrants of an older generation get stuck in the way their country was whenever they left. That being said, yeah, a lot of East Asian cultures have patriarchal leanings (as do many western cultures)- before I get pilloried for making things about gender I will just note that in my family my grandfather has described how his mother chose to starve the girls to feed the boys during famine and one of his sisters died (yes, this was a shitty situation for everyone but also yes, she decided who would live based on gender), and my grandmother was nearly beaten to death by her father bc she wanted to keep going to school. So, these things are not so far in the past as perhaps we think they are and it's not realistic to think that all prejudices against women would disappear overnight. 

I think for me, there's a question about which things you feel ok about putting up w (bc it's not necessarily bad or wrong to accommodate someone else's preferences or sensibilities about manners) and which things you would worry about being passed along to hypothetical future children (you don't have to want to have kids I just think that this is a helpful thought exercise). For instance, you might not usually do the dishes, but be fine w doing them at MIL's house as a courtesy bc it aligns w the value of being a good guest BUT if you had a kid you would want to make sure that what they're learning isn't ""women have to do dishes and men get to sit around."" So, the compromise might be, you and BF both do dishes, and if you had kids, they would be expected to help too (in age appropriate ways) regardless of gender, even if MIL were to say ""oh no, Johnny doesn't have to help, Jane has it covered"" or something like that.

 It sounds like there some lovely things your in-laws do to show they care about each other, which are definitely things you would want to pass down/participate in, but that there are also some things that you wouldn't feel comfortable perpetuating- these are thing that your BF will need to start thinking about for himself, esp re: examples being set for kids in the family (whether they're his kids or other kids who are around). It's ultimately his responsibility to ensure that his partner is treated well by his family, and more likely than not his family will adjust, at least a little bit, if he makes it clear what is/isn't appropriate behavior. That doesn't mean he has to have a knock down drag out fight, but even little supportive comments like, ""I love the way X looks"" ""I like to dress comfortably too"" or ""I like doing the dishes, don't you think it's important for everyone to contribute, especially after MIL worked so hard on cooking"" can be helpful in changing the tone."
BeBackInASchmeck,,"The genders are flipped, but my wife is Vietnamese from a conservative Vietnamese immigrant, working class family, and I'm 1st generation, upper class.

There are two very important things you need to accept first:

1. They WILL NOT change.  Not for you.  Not for their son.  Not for money or opportunities.  Not under threats.

2. They WILL NEVER like you or respect you as much as you want.  You will never be good enough for them, even if you were a beautiful, Vietnamese doctor, who only has to work 30 hours a week, speaks fluent Vietnamese, and are close with your family.

It's probably best to do what your boyfriend recommends. Ignore what they say.  Smile and nod politely.  Answer their questions in short responses.  If a question might have a controversial response, just lie to them to get them to drop the subject.  Don't bother arguing with them.  

Your boyfriend is probably yelling at them for their inappropriate behavior, and he doesn't want you to know about it.  You won't have to deal with them for too long, and just avoid them whenever you can.

Some relationships are even more intense with the in-law criticism and some relationships the partner has super rigid boundaries and shields like heck.  What you are running up against is a clash of your values versus boyfriend and a clear demonstration of his willingness to make excuses versus rock the boat.

Nylese,pinay and desi,"> Jennifer Lee, a sociologist at the University of California, Irvine says affirmative action policies can in fact help some Asian-Americans, which are a very diverse group. ""You have Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmong Americans who have higher high school dropout rates than African-Americans and Latino Americans,"" Lee says. ""So, when we think about race-conscious admissions and whether they would help Asian-Americans, we have to really think about who Asian-Americans are as a community.""

""It's a very different thing to allege that affirmative action is discriminating against Asian-Americans, a minority group that has been subject to official and private discrimination throughout American history.""

I think this is the key fact affirmative action supporters have to come to terms with. There is no way to directly increase underrepresented minority acceptances at colleges without hurting Asians. We should be looking at policies that help everyone, but for which underrepresented minorites have more to gain from. And this means we have to start reform from the very start and possibly in areas that aren't traditionally in the realm of education.

I'm personally for AA even though I recognize that it's not beneficial to my community though. I just wish it was done through economic status or based on schooling rather than ethnicity.

dearcicada,,"i'm especially concerned about the trend of using asian american students wedge against the current state of affirmative action. the author does a good job in balancing the asian american story. low income aa studnets excel despite economic hardships but we have to also realize how selective the asian immigrant pool is (majority of the parents are college graduates) and how other minorities aren't under the same circumstances. 

our struggles and success shouldn't be minimized through the model minority myth but our story should not be used as a wedge to further divide us from struggles that latinx and black students and even poor, rural white students face. 

it quitely honestly pisses me off when white moderates/conservatives use our academic excellence as a pawn, under the guise of concern. 

i also wish the discourse on this issue wasn't so prone to devolving into attacking other minorities. affirmative action is one of the biggest topics that divide minorities, especially in the asian american circle—for good reason, but i often feel that the hostility is misguided. "
hamjandy,,"Yeah, and a a lot of it is also about being seen as the perpetual foreigner and having to work twice as hard to get half as far. Unlike pure economic instability, that aspect of it can't be remedied by personal achievement, so even wealthier people still push their kids in America. Also, the wealthy Asians in the US likely got there through sheer effort, so end up passing down similar family values.

Do wealthy Chinese parents push their kids this hard when they live in China? It feels like the wealthy Chinese are the ones who can afford to let their kids fuck up their entrance exams because they can always send their kid to a school abroad. I acknowledge that this might be colored by international students I've known and family friends in China."
,,"From what I understand, there's a similar culture re: extracurriculars/tutoring in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. I knew a few family friends who went to China and lied about their credentials so they could earn $50k a month as tutors for rich kids. This was a few years ago, don't know if it's still feasible today..."
Lanai,,"So one thing to consider is that many Whites cite that because Asians are discriminated against by affirmative action that it should be gotten rid of. 

The questions is who's side do we take? Do we try to support APIs, in exchange for further oppressing those who benefit from it the most, Hispanic and Blacks, who have like Asians, been historically oppressed. Or do we find alternatives to improve API representation in schools.

Secondly, we must not forget that Southeast Asians (Cambodians, Laos, Hmongs, etc.), and other non-east Asians have the LOWEST college attendance rates. If affirmative action were to be removed, they wouldn't get the same opportunities they receive now. "
MALNOURISHED_DOG,,Fully agree. I'm sorry if it seems like I don't have much to add but that is exactly my stance on the topic 
snapekillseddard,,"THANK YOU.

I do believe that Asian Americans can be discriminated against, due to affirmative action, but it's not a system that is intended for us. Whenever we complain about how ""unfair"" a system it is, I think we're just as bad as the clueless white people who have no goddamn idea how difficult it can be for minorities in this country."
,,"Race-based affirmative action is a crappy 1960's era solution to a 2010's problem. Back in the 60's, there was by law segregation that actively restricted education. Race simply isn't the barrier to education anymore. Instead, it's income now and will be until the cost of education goes down by sufficient technological advances. Schools in lower income areas have far less educational opportunities than schools in higher income areas.


Furthermore, the main beneficiaries of purely race based admissions has been higher class minorities. In this day and age, I fail to see how whatever structural racism remains isn't cancelled out by the wealth of educational opportunities available to people of higher income regardless of race. "

proper_b_wayne,,"If it is unclear, I definitely agree that the current form of affirmative action system is unfair to AAs. However, I just don't feel fighting other minorities, in perhaps worse situation than us, is a worthy pursuit. Yes, higher class non-asian minorities (who probably don't need a crutch) benefits more than their lower class. But, there are still things of value being delivered to their lower class in this system.

Why fight the other minorities over some small privilege that compensate disadvantages in other areas of their life? If higher class non-asian minorities don't need a crutch over the rest of the population, white americans REALLY don't need a crutch over AAs.

I also think it is much easier to convince people that affirmative action should be changed so that AAs and white americans compete on the same level, rather than the whole thing should be abolished and the underprivileged minorities can go suck it. If we get to experience the same standard of treatment in education as white americans, it would be a vast improvement over the situation now."

> To be honest, I think this will turn out to be a good thing for AAs long term. Too many 1st/2nd generation parents teach/force their kids to game the system the wrong way that puts way too much emphasis on looking great on paper instead of developing useful social skills. 

I agree that 1st/2nd gen parents put too much emphasis on test scores, and not enough on social skills, but I don't see how college admission being harshest on AAs will make us develop social skills. I just don't see it as a big factor. Also, the parents will more likely push their children even harder and force them to spend even more time studying to compensate for the harsher requirements, rather than becoming laxer on their children. AAs will realize social skills and networking are incredibly important when they step into real life, regardless of how well they did in school. 

Also, I don't think asian cultures dismiss social skill and networking as important. IMHO, they place even more importance on it than the west. It is just that the ones who US lets in are highly educated docile workers, while those shrewd business man, social hustlers, rebels remains in Asia. So these 1st/2nd gen parents will teach their child how to succeed in life in the way that they succeeded, by burying yourself in books and studying. The next wave of immigrants will come here in the exact same way, so in effect 1st/2nd gen parents will never ""realize"" the importance of social skills over test scores.

> and I don't buy the argument that the pre-existing networks are impossible to crack, you just have to find the right one. 

It is not impossible, but it is definitely much harder. Why would we accept or want this penalty on us? We don't have some sort of magical asian competitive advantage, such that even with this penalty on us, we can still do well.

Lanai,,"I can only speak for the University of California (UC), but yes, the UC system takes into account your specific ethnicity and asks that you report it on your applications. Laos, Cambodia, Hmong, etc. are all included, as well as other minor ethnicities from areas such as the Middle East and East Europe. But at the same time,  affirmative action is not allowed in California due to proposition 209."
Lanai,,"It depends on the school system. Since no school is allowed a quota based on your race (Regents of the University of California v. Bakke), the system must be 'narrowly tailored' to consider race, through things like UT's top 10% program. Though this will change due to Fisher v. University of Texas. Whether the school considers ethnicities within the context of race, its up to the school. 

I do know at the UC, they will use special outreach methods to those who identify in groups I've mentioned before. But 'outreach' is different than 'admissions' (in order to maintain compliance with prop 209)."
Lanai,,"I agree with you, however in do believe we should look at the intersectionality of race and income when appropriating affirmative action funds. To assume a poor Hmong student from Montana with immigrant parents who dont speak English has the same opportunities as a poor white student whose parents are poor but grew up with support networks in the inner city of NYC would be a grave mistake. So, yes, income should be considered, but it should not be the sole determinate factor. Nor should race."

proper_b_wayne,,"> As someone from outside the US (and who actually took SAT exams before deciding not to apply to US colleges) I've always felt that socio-economic based affirmative action would be much more effective then race based affirmative action - perhaps look at income/wealth of households/caretakers along with vulnerable demographic areas. Why hasn't this been implemented? Nevermind I'm asking a question with an obvious answer.

Socio-economic based affirmative action would also make much more sense to me than the current system. I think it is also a better solution. Yeah, maybe the rich who owns the media and the upper middle-class media savvy types won't be happy about it, so the dialogue on it in public space has been kept to a minimum.

> Obama's daughters apply for college they'll be given +300 points to their SAT score whilst if the sort of Asians who appear in these sort of videos ever apply, 200 points will already have been deducted from their score

That attitude screams ""I can only do something as long as the system allows me to do it,"" and that's the exact attitude that AAs need to get away from. The key will be the AAs that step into real life here, and you are selling AAs short if you think AAs will just go more hardcore on test scores. My experiences with 3rd+ generation AAs tells me it's the exact opposite. Test scores are worthless after you get in, social skills will last your lifetime.

Whatever social skills and networking skills are important in Asian cultures are irrelevant to AAs if they aren't being valued by parents of AAs. That's where the biggest change is needed and AAs can change on our own. There are bigger issues than just the system if the 3th/4th generations still can't figure it out.

I just don't see why we can't adapting ourselves to the system while also pushing the system to change in our favor. It is not mutually exclusive.

I don't think I got my point across clearly. I do think most if not all 3rd/4th gen AA realize social skill is important. Hell, most 1st/2nd gen probably realized it, albeit later in life. However, AA population will be constantly replenished by oversea immigrants, and there is a selective force for asian immigrants who put less value on social skills and more on academic/employable skills. So if you look at the community as a whole, the AA community attitude on average won't change that much. This is my explanation for this phenomenon. So I am arguing that making life harder for those who are already here will have little effect on changing this work-hard philosophy if you look at the entire population as one.

Here's how the Asian American members of the state assembly voted (may be incomplete). Basically the vote was along party lines.

Yeas:

* Rob Bonta (D-Alameda)

* David Chiu (D-San Francisco)

* Todd Gloria (D-San Diego)

* Ash Kalra (D-San Jose)

* Evan Low (D-Campbell)

* Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance)

* Steven Choi (R-Irvine)

* Tyler Diep (R-Westminster)

* Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield)

Did not vote:

* Ed Chau (D-Arcadia)

* Kansen Chu (D-San Jose)

As the below excerpt shows, there was not the same organized opposition by Asian legislators this time around:

> “The act of giving special or preferential treatment to someone based on their race is racism itself, or on sex is sexism,” said Assemblyman Steven Choi, R-Irvine. “Just ask yourself, is it right to give someone a job just because they are white or black or green or yellow? Or just because they are male?”

> The Legislature last took up the issue in 2014, when the state Senate passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would have asked voters to reverse the ban on consideration of race and sex in college admissions. The Assembly shelved the measure after Asian Americans said it could limit their children’s ability to get into California’s most selective public universities, where Asian Americans make up a greater share of students than in the overall population.

> That tension was laid bare again Wednesday. Several Asian American legislators who ultimately voted for the measure said proponents of bringing back affirmative action had not done enough outreach to their community. They said many of their constituents fear a repeal of Prop. 209 would undo gains they have worked hard to achieve.

> “Asian Americans, just like everyone else, we are seeking equal opportunity. We want to be treated fairly,” said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance (Los Angeles County).

> Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, said his office had received more than 3,000 calls from constituents who opposed ACA5 and only 99 from people who supported it. He raised the possibility that his vote could cost him his seat, adding that he had heard from elected officials in his district who asked him, “Aren’t you yellow? Why are you voting against your own people?”

Low's vote is basically a Principal Skinner ""[Am I so out of touch? It's them who are wrong](https://youtube.com/watch?v=HMqZ2PPOLik)"" moment.

Here's another Democrat trying to have it both ways:

Isn't the soft bigotry of low expectations a *result* of affirmative action or diversity admissions/hires?

Ultimately, is the choice really a binary between ""me first"" vs. ""the greater good"" when it comes to Asian Americans and affirmative action?

To insert my personal experience: I was rejected from three UCs (Davis, Irvine, and San Diego) with a B average, 2000s SAT, and minimal extracurricular activities when I applied in 2008. So I doubt that I would've gotten in without Prop 209."

bdodo,,"tl;dr: Affirmative action in other countries has mixed results, and there are consistent pros and cons. I think the pros are slight, while the cons can be very damaging. I think prop 209 should stay.

All the criticisms and support for affirmative action are borne out to some extent in other countries, although affirmative action looks very different in other countries because of different group histories, policies, and implementations. 

[main source for stuff I'm saying](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/does-affirmative-action-work)

For example, can it increase bigotry? Yes; in Malaysia, affirmative actions for Malays (who were disadvantaged compared to Chinese and Indians in Malaysia) led to a ""hyperconsciousness of ethnicity."" Chinese and Malay institutions regularly segregated themselves by race as recently as 2010.

Can it benefit all citizens? Economically, Malaysia's GDP increased steadily from 1970 (a year before the affirmative action law was enacted) to 2015 (when my referenced article was published). So at least in terms of economics, it doesn't seem to have *hurt.*

Sometimes it can *aid* minorities in poverty (not by itself do enough to lift them out of it), while other times, it is corrupted and abused by rich minorities to retain wealth among themselves. This is shown in scandals in India and Malaysia. In South Africa, the first attempt at affirmative action just spread wealth among black entrepreneurs, not trickling down to workers. The second attempt in 2003, which targeted the education and promotion of black workers, reduced black poverty by 15% by 2015, although the total rate was still over 50%.

Something to be clear of though: Advocates for affirmative action, especially for college admissions, are deceived if they think it doesn't hurt Asians. There is a finite amount of spots in a college. If more people of one race get it, fewer of others get it. That is a fact. The catch is this: I read once from a study, that it actually only *barely* hurts Asians, at least at Ivy Leagues, since there are so few black and Latino people applying. The study said something like Asians' chance of acceptance only dropped by 1% or something.

Despite all this, no one can be *sure* of what would happen with affirmative action in California--how it might be structured, and what would come of that. Even if we admitted more black students, they could just hang out in black clubs, and whites would talk to whites, etc. Their wealth might not spread to the poor black neighborhoods. Racial tensions could escalate. Or maybe affirmative action could help, at least a little, but not fix poverty rates among minorities. 

My opinion is, it seems that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. I think prop 209 should stay."
nosotros_road_sodium,Chinese-American,"Case in point: In 1998, 61% of California voters [passed Proposition 227](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_California_Proposition_227), which banned bilingual education in the state. Eighteen years later, 74% voted to reverse that ban with [Prop 58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_California_Proposition_58) in 2016. Yet in that same election day, [53% voted to uphold the death penalty](http://web.archive.org/web/20161202002654/http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures/). California may strongly prefer Democrats for president and governor, but don't count on them to vote for every left wing cause.

Also, are there legitimate cases of Prop 209 causing well qualified black or Hispanic applicants to be rejected from colleges, state jobs, or government contracts in California? I would expect the 209 opponents to have at least *some* anecdotal evidence, rather than merely pointing at UC enrollment numbers (regardless of the fact that [black and Hispanic graduation rates went up after 209](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/prop209.pdf)).

Ultimately, it boils down to what's the most ethical, logical choice. Let's say this initiative does make it to the ballot. Would an Asian American parent potentially vote to reduce their kid's chance at getting in a UC in the name of the ""greater good"" of diversity? Did 209 prove that a meritocracy *can* also be diverse?

But, I'll start off with her first point that 'most Asian Americans actually support affirmative action even on college campuses'.

>""Extrapolating poll results such as these to views of colleges' affirmative action programs is difficult -- in large part because affirmative action means different things to different people and some definitions appear to result in lower levels of support. Generally, support in general terms (when people appear to be thinking about recruitment efforts) is strong. But support drops if affirmative action is defined as ""a preference"" for some groups over others in how candidates for admission are evaluated.""

https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2017/10/30/survey-draws-attention-white-perceptions-affirmative-action

If you look at the Gallup polls, you got two dramatically different responses for affirmative action depending on how they asked the question.

In one Gallup poll, they got 69% support for affirmative action from white people when they asked, 'do you generally favor or oppose affirmative action programs for racial minorities.' 

And, that's similar to how the polls she's referring to were asked.

But, the other Gallup poll only showed 28% approval for affirmative action when it asked 'when evaluating students for admission into a college or university, if an applicant's racial or ethnic background should be considered to help promote diversity on college campuses.'"

Better to ban it and try our best to enforce the law than to give the loaded gun that once belonged to white racists to a new person and hope they don't shoot us.

But you really can't deny that Asians have been held to a higher standard than everyone else. It's just empirically true. And it's not just grades and scores. Asians learned that a long time ago, you also need a ton of extracurriculars, you need to stand out in non-academic ways. They do that but.... so are all the other Asians.

This is the crux of the ""divide and conquer"" strategy, and while it doesn't change the fact that affirmative action is bad for AA's regardless of how it's implemented, but it does show that AA reasons for wanting to reform affirmative action will differ substantially from the ways the white status quo would want to change it."

Affirmative Action was intended to protect ethnic minorities from being denied positions they are qualified for but in practise it is used to reinforce old stereotypes about race.  Moreover, there are some Affirmative Action activists who are complaining that it is not working for Black people because the system is letting in Black people who are African Immigrants or from middle-class backgrounds rather than so-called Traditional Blacks who are Americanised and from working-class backgrounds.

,,"Not to take  internment camps and such things lightly, but it is a couple magnitudes below slavery."
uardito,,"I think it might be tactically imprudent to broadly understand American racism through the lens of racism against African Americans. Like, talking about white privilege or a hierarchy of racial privilege lends itself to this and Jon Stewart's interview illustrates how this can get problematic: Racism against African Americans becomes the purest form of racism and then O'Reilly's argument that Asians enjoy more privilege than white people is very natural. And that pits Asian and African Americans against each other, which is something else to avoid.

And many aspects of the racist dehumanization facing African Americans have analogues in the racism toward Asians, but on the surface look radically unrelated. Take media portrayals of male sexuality for example. Black men are often painted as being so hyper masculine that they're unable to be human or civilized. You see this in a lot of ways from the idea that Black men are naturally violent and sexual predators to having large penises. Media representations of Asian men, in contrast, are emasculated and desexualized in a variety of way, like this idea that Asian men's penises are small. From that perspective, they seem terribly related, but this racism against African Americans is visible in incarceration rates, but the Asian analogue is invisible from this perspective.

Plus, not being careful down that road could undermine our argument. Like, in the wakes of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and US slavery was the birth of Chinese indentured servitude. On this level, they're really related: One replaced the other in America's demand for cheap labor. And while the brutal exploitation of labor was a theme to both, slavery and Jim Crow had an extra dimension of violence to it that is echoed today in police brutality against African Americans and that's less visible in modern racism toward Asian Americans.

And there's some stuff that's just off the wall and harder to compare. Like I think the American paranoia about MSG at Chinese restaurants (and meat quality and content come to think about it) is part of this larger idea that Asian Americans are not *really* Americans and have some natural foreign allegiance. Or something. I'm not sure I understand it. MSG is delicious and everyone's okay when Chick Fil-A and Doritos use catastrophic amounts of MSG, but suddenly everyone develops allergies to it at Chinese restaurants. I don't see an analogue to this in racism against African Americans. (Lol, I concede that's a pathetically weak argument: I can't see it, so it must not exist, but yeah. If you do see it, let me know.)

I say all this when I agree with the parallels the OP draws. We just shouldn't limit our understanding of racism against Asian Americans to that lens and also be careful drawing parallels that might inadvertently trivialize differences in scale of brutality or whatever.

And I'm sorry this got so long :-("

For consistency's sake, I'm pretty sure that SCOTUS will overturn the 5th's decision. That it's getting reviewed surprises me, because in the past the Court has been happy to let the district courts establish to what degree their decisions are to be enforced, because it hasn't just been with Fisher where recent decisions by the lower courts haven't really been applying strict scrutiny. In the 2A world we've been noticing that with the declining to review Jackson, rejecting the NRA appeal to overturn California's storage laws and hollowpoint ban, and the 4th District's decision on AR-15 being allowed to stand; that and more undermining what was found in Heller."

However, I do support affirmative action as far as employment goes as long as the best qualified person for the job is selected and not the best qualified by ethnicity to the exclusion of other ethnicities (is that a word?). "
yangstalicious,,"I think a lot of people support the idea that spawned AA (ie, we should make sure that disadvantage people are not locked out of opportunities for success) but disagree with the implementation/execution of AA. It's sad that many debates center around ""yes we should have AA"" or ""no we should not"" when really it should be ""how do we achieve this goal of making sure that people from disadvantaged socio-economic classes also get the opportunity to succeed? Does the solution look like AA? or something else entirely?"""
fukkboiinternational,,"I support AA too, insofar as it functions as a way to give underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged groups a leg up in admissions.

As it exists now, AA is more or less a carte blanche given to admissions offices to set up artificial quotas on how many and what kind of person to admit. The statistics have been posted here ad nauseam, but it bears repeating that when AA is implemented in the American college system, it expands enrollment for African Americans, non-white Hispanics, and other groups, lowers admissions for Asian Americans, but leaves white admissions more or less untouched.

Others have suggested this before, but if we're sincerely going to pursue AA as a way to address historical injustices and promote education among underrepresented minorities, then the group most aggressively seeking to implement AA, and who are most responsible for those same historical injustices, ought to bear some of the burden of advancing opportunities to underrepresented minorities.

Correcting historical injustice is all well and good but setting up these programs and passing the buck onto Asian Americans is unfair and hypocritical. AA needs to exist but I want to see some tangible evidence of power-wielding majority doing their part to make it happen too."

Immediately after Prop 209 passed, the white percentage in UC schools remained relatively similar to pre-Prop 209 levels for a few years before dropping.

There's a finite number of stem students a given school will take. Given how many Asians looks to pursue stem, that's a natural ""cap"" to Asian proportions at schools by itself.

California is also a poor comp for northeast liberal arts schools in general, as California has a huge Asian population. Compare 15% California Asians and 40% at Berkeley and 5% national and 20 to 30% at Harvard and MIT, and there's a larger ""disproportion"" at the latter.

If you want to try looking outside of school, have you heard of Vocational Rehabilitation? It is a state govt run thing. Their main thing is to equip low income people with any job period, usually bare minimum, but if you talk to the right counselor, you should be able to have full tuition paid up until undergrad. How the tuition part works is they would pay anything left over by your Pell Grant.

 Also depending on you income situation, they cover so many things such as housing, computer. school supplies etc. But know that it would be bare minimum stuff. For example, they would put you in housing with 4 bed room, bare minimum lap tops etc.

These are case by case scenarios, so you would need to talk to a counselor.

The process may take you way longer than when you need the support for your conference. However, keep this one in mind for your future education. It helped me get through my premed years ago :) But this state run program changed alot since I started it. When I started it, they were very flexible with the payments.

One of my request was to have 100% control of the hiring process in my department. With the systemic racism in my industry, minority never received that opportunity. I bought in more minority for interview and now everyone that I hired in my department now are minority except one. I'm trying to do my part by helping other asian and minority get their foot in the door. 

I was never going to get the first job or even get interview by merit alone. But I took the opportunity that I received and making changes to the systemic racism.

I respect my relative's decision to carry since it seems to give her some sense of safety that she definitely deserves, though I can't say getting a gun myself would make me feel any safer. If someone were to pull a gun on me, I can't help but think, what's even going to happen if I tried to pull my own out? I just feel like I'll end up getting shot anyway, if not encouraging it. 

But this in the case of a robbery. Tbh, the  most recent tragic events that I've read of, iirc, the assailants were homeless and had mental health issues. Will pulling a gun on a mentally unsound person really make them stop? Shooting them down might, and maybe if you havent frozen in fear for the moment, you've been keeping up on practice shooting or maybe are just lucky, you'll still be alive, but that's not the end of the issue. Now you have to deal with the legal issues, stress of the situation, maybe the complex feelings that will follow killing someone, even with justification. It's just suffering either way. In a perfect world, this wouldn't happen to begin with, and the entire situation could be avoided. I feel a lot of hopelessness when thinking of situations like this. 

TLDR: to answer your questions, I don't own a gun, but many in my family do. I'd say maybe a couple of them take them out. My state is fairly gun friendly, I guess? Many would say very soft on crime here; I don't know what to think other than whatever is being done is ineffective for many of the issues at hand.

In American politics, the right-wing side may support dramatically increasing the number of gun owners, and the left-wing side wants to ban all guns. The optimal situation might be where guns are only accessible to the appropriate people. Unfortunately, policy related to guns does not always follow the scientific developments, and there are a lot of political forces that will ultimately be the main influence on what policy is passed. NYC seems to be a place where the political forces have just decided to ban all conceal carry, refusing to confront the reality that for example if some murder victims have had guns, they would still be alive now. Perhaps stuff like MMA will be included in what I will be doing. Of course we might still make excuses to not take some precaution but I think it is wrong if we jeopardize our own lives. I just need to think of some way to maximize the amount of benefit from the limited resources that I have."
ClayTart,,"I am really sorry that happened to your relative and I totally respect her decision to get a gun and never go back to SF. 

I think that it is a valid perspective that you feel having a gun may not always play out positively if there is a case where self-defense is needed. Indeed there are many ways that having a gun might enhance danger that is presented to you, but there are also many ways that having a gun vastly reduces the odds of you suffering severe physical harm that is applicable to most individuals willing to take the necessary safeguards and education on how to handle guns and handle self-defense situations. Fundamentally, it depends on the circumstances unique to each individual, and I cannot make a broad claim about literally everybody concerned with self-defense. 

On the point of mentally unsound individuals, the theory to a gun is that you will shoot if you draw the gun. You will not draw the gun if you do not intend to shoot, and the effect of shooting is to incapacitate the threat while help can be on the way. From my standpoint, in many of the hate crimes that we have seen in national news, the use of a gun would have been justified because imminent physical harm has commenced, and at any point within the duration it is appropriate to use a gun. I can't speak to how it would play out legally though because the results of many legal proceedings following the self defense incidents have not concluded, but if it is a choice between being murdered or facing some legal proceedings, I think one choice is more favorable in some sense...

With that being said, I respect your decision to choose to not own a gun, but I would implore you to demonstrate increased caution in response to the hate crimes, whatever that may be. It is theoretically possible for someone to be safer in a safe city without a gun than in a dangerous city with a gun, but I think the best case scenario is to be in a safe city with a gun and with self defense education.

The ones who want to ban guns are old school Democrats like Dianne Feinstein who really aren't worthy of the ""left"" label anymore.

Also, de-escalation and escape are generally better options than any form of escalation, whether it's a gun or an arm bar."
ByronicAsian,,"> Is it even legal for them to not get back to you in over nine months?

Technically no.

NYC Administrative Code §§10-303 states the Rifle/Shotgun permit investigation shouldn't take longer than 60 days lest they must provide an explanation in writing. 

Similarly, NY Penal Law § 400 (4-a) states that action must be taken withing 6 months of ""presentment"" of the application before the licensing authority. 

However, IIRC both of these time limits weren't really adhered to even prior to the pandemic. Plus there is no real enforcement mechanism or penalty for them violating these limits written into the books.

AFAIK, other downstate counties outside of NYC also play games on what counts as when the application is considered ""submitted"" and ""presented"" meaning they can delay it for quite a bit before they 6 month clock even starts.

> It seems like you are taking the precaution of buying a gun for the house just in case self-defense is needed. 

Realistically, its somewhat lower on my list of priorities here as home invasions in my neighborhood is exceedingly rare. I'm just into shooting as a hobby. My job also forbids weapons on premises so if I go back to the office, thats at least 2 or 3 days a week that I can't carry.

> I also think that there is an upcoming Supreme Court case NYSRPA v Bruen that may expand concealed carry, but it is likely to still allow some restrictions.

I would wager if NYSRPA v Bruen goes the way of the Petitioners, then Greco v. NYC (the case specifically dealing with carry in NYC that was stayed pending the oral arguments) will be decided based off whatever is decided by SCOTUS in Bruen). We might see something like Washington D.C's law. You're allowed to carry but:

1) No Firearms Allowed signs have force of law.

2) No CCW within 250ft of a school, protest, diplomat, public official, public parks

3) No CCW on public transport or at restaurants that serve alcohol.

4) 16hr training course with 2hrs of live fire with PD approved instructors"
Goofalo,,"No, I do not think having a concealed carry license makes me feel safer. Why? Because I am bringing a firearm to places and situations where firearms weren’t before I got there. And I accept that. It is an enormous responsibility to carry a firearm. What makes me feel safer is having situational awareness. Like, I don’t stare at my phone on the train past a certain hour, I don’t walk with earbuds in drowning out all the sound, I don’t walk through alleys and dimly lit side streets late at night. Chicago’s violence, although bad, is overblown. I honestly feel a lot of it is based on racist fear. The dangerous neighborhoods to me are the well off neighborhoods on the north side where there are a lot of bars and a lot of privilege. Alcohol and privilege has presented a more realistic danger to my everyday life than some gang beef.

But if someone thinks walking around with a gun is going to make them feel safer, I don’t think that person should own a firearm. A firearm is a tool. You make yourself feel safer by being more situationally aware, being able to recognize a bad situation and how to avoid them, or remove yourself from them. 

Presenting a firearm automatically escalates any situation you are in drastically. And since I am not a white dude, no one, especially not the police are going to see me as a “good guy with a gun.” If I draw my firearm in public, I am going to create panic and the Chicago police will probably murder me because everyone is going to tell 911, that an Asian dude has a gun and that is all anyone is going to focus on.

I own firearms because approximately 5 - 6 % of Americans identify and express with white supremacist beliefs.  That means there are 16 million of them in the US. That is 16 million too many, and I aim to make racists afraid again."

It’s especially frustrating when it’s coming from  immigrants who have benefitted from selective immigration policies. 

I want these people to sit down with people on the black community and see if they still hold the views after."
unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"







SEATTLE — As he stood before a bustling ballroom at a Chinese restaurant on Lake Union in September, Washington State’s former governor Gary Locke began by acknowledging the tension in the crowd.

“Many of you in the audience are saying that I’m turning my back to the Chinese community,” said Mr. Locke, who is the only Chinese-American to serve as a state governor.

It was during Mr. Locke’s first term more than two decades ago that state voters, over his opposition, approved one of the nation’s first bans on affirmative action. Now Mr. Locke is taking on a difficult new role in the fight to overturn the ban, trying to persuade voters — in particular, other Asian-Americans — to support a ballot measure that could restore affirmative action in the state’s public sector.

As one of eight states that prohibit such diversity efforts, Washington faces a reckoning over a policy that has contributed to a steep slide in the number of state government contracts going toward businesses owned by minorities or women. That has helped feed a persistent gap in economic inequality, in particular for African-Americans and Native Americans, who have both suffered under centuries of discrimination.


While affirmative action policies have faced decades of legal challenges, courts have largely sustained race-conscious practices. Many of the existing bans came by way of public votes that were framed as anti-discrimination measures. California’s pioneering ban, approved in 1996, was titled the California Civil Rights Initiative. Washington followed suit, as did several other states.

Lawmakers have let the measures stand ever since, but supporters of affirmative action in Washington State forced the issue this year by collecting enough signatures for a ballot measure, scheduled for a vote on Tuesday, that would once again allow concerted efforts to increase diversity.

The measure would still prohibit “preferential treatment,” defined as using a factor such as race, gender or age to select a lesser-qualified candidate. But those factors could be considered, at least, in efforts to increase diversity in education, employment and contracting. Recruitment programs would be allowed to focus on minority candidates.

While the arguments over affirmative action have changed little over the years, proponents in Washington believe the time is ripe to revisit the issue, as the country becomes increasingly aware of lingering racial and gender inequities. The campaign is forcing voters in Washington, one of the nation’s most liberal states, to confront the fact that their state bans race-conscious diversity programs while more conservative states in the South do not.

Opposition to affirmative action has long centered on white men and conservatives complaining about “reverse discrimination.” Challenges to those policies have also come from some Asian-Americans who worry that their success in winning jobs and college admission spots may suffer in a quest to open opportunities to other racial and ethnic groups.

For Many Widows, the Hardest Part Is Mealtime
While polls have indicated that many Asian-Americans, particularly younger ones, support affirmative action programs, the funding and organizing for the current campaign to uphold Washington’s prohibition has come overwhelmingly from members of that ethnic group.

Mr. Locke, who also served as a former commerce secretary and ambassador to China, said he felt compelled to step forward — in part because he has benefited from affirmative action. He said some recent immigrants do not appreciate the depth of racial inequality upon which the United States has grown.

“Asian-Americans have made great progress in our society,” Mr. Locke told the group at the restaurant event, “but that doesn’t mean that we can’t make sure that other ethnic groups also enjoy those opportunities.”

Opponents handed out fliers ahead of Mr. Locke’s speech that said the effort to restore affirmative action would “abolish the standard of equality for all.” Others challenged Mr. Locke with questions about how such policies would work in practice.

ZhiQing Yao, a software engineer from the Seattle area, said he worried that new policies would undermine the ideals of the country that he came to 17 years ago from China.

“We came to the United States because the country has equal opportunity for everyone,” Mr. Yao said. “This is really un-American.”

Asian-Americans have led other efforts, including a recent lawsuit against Harvard that seeks to upend the practice of using race and ethnicity as factors in college admissions. When California considered a repeal of its ban on affirmative action a few years ago, the plan was dropped amid pressure from, among others, the Asian-American community.

But the idea of repealing California’s ban under Proposition 209 has continued to gain momentum in recent years, said Rusty Hicks, the chair of the California Democratic Party. This month, party leaders there plan to adopt a new platform that would more frequently voice support for affirmative action.

Mr. Hicks said leaders in the state would be watching the outcome of the vote in Washington State.

“It would be my guess that, in the coming years, Proposition 209 is revisited,” Mr. Hicks said.Starting in the ’90s
After California and Washington passed the first bans on affirmative action, other states adopted their own prohibitions: Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, Arizona, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.

But in the years after Washington’s law was approved in 1998, state data shows a precipitous drop in the number of minority- and women-owned businesses that obtained government contracts.

The state’s Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises looked at eligible state spending and found that before the ban in the 1990s, about 10 percent of government contract funds went to businesses certified as being led by minorities or women. Since the ban, that proportion has dropped; in recent years it has accounted for about 3 percent of spending.

The office determined that if the state had awarded 10 percent of contracts to women- or minority-owned businesses, those enterprises would have gained about $3.5 billion.

California considered repealing its ban as recently as 2014, when Ed Hernandez, then a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area, proposed a constitutional amendment to put a measure on the ballot.

In an interview, Mr. Hernandez, who has since left the Legislature and works as an optometrist, said he believed that affirmative action helped him earn his degrees; bringing it back, he said, would help alleviate doctor shortfalls in minority communities.

“When I look at it from a health perspective side, there is a huge need for culturally sensitive providers to go to those communities,” Mr. Hernandez said.

The 2014 legislation drew vehement public opposition, much of it from Asian-American groups. Though three Asian-American senators were among those who helped it initially pass the Senate, it stalled in the Assembly.

Public views on the issue have been shifting, however. Gallup found this year that a majority of white Americans favored affirmative action programs for minorities — a first for a poll that has tracked the issue for years.

And this year, supporters of affirmative action in Washington submitted nearly 400,000 signatures — a record for an initiative to the Legislature in a state with a long history of such campaigns — in support of ending the ban. The Legislature adopted the measure, and then opponents gathered enough signatures to force a public vote.

April Sims, a leader in the Washington State Labor Council who is co-chairing this year’s initiative campaign, said she believed that voters were ready for a conversation about opportunity and fairness.

“It’s past time to right this wrong,” Ms. Sims said.

A New Era
When he was a high school student in Seattle in the 1960s, Mr. Locke recalled, recruiters from Yale visited the public school he attended and encouraged people to apply.

Mr. Locke said Yale had few minority students at the time, and almost no Asian-Americans. Many of its students came from private schools on the East Coast. Mr. Locke said the renewed effort to recruit a more diverse student body gave him the chance to win admission.

“I was a product of affirmative action,” Mr. Locke said.

He is now joined in supporting the affirmative action plan by another former Washington governor, Dan Evans, a Republican, who said the state’s strong economy and culture of innovation reflect a state that values diversity.

“Unfortunately, for the past 20 years, Washington has turned back the clock on this commitment,” Mr. Evans said.

Much of the opposition has focused on how affirmative action would affect the state’s universities.

The New York Times in 2013 examined the data on university admissions after affirmative action bans were adopted, and found evidence that in some states, the bans appeared to have had a negative impact on minority admissions, especially in California.

Data from the University of Washington showed a widening downward gap between the school’s enrollment numbers of African-American students, as well as Hispanic students, compared with their presence in the state’s overall college-age population."

HiBrucke6,,I'm Asian American and I've been opposed to affirmative action programs since their inception years ago.  I've always felt that merit should be the first consideration for acceptance whether to a college or for a job.  I applied for a college scholarship that was based entirely on the scores earned on a competitive test (the highest score got the scholarship).   I won that scholarship and bristled at the comments from fellow students that I got a scholarship to college because I'm of a minority ethnicity.  I applied for a job and got an offer based strictly on my 'blind' resume in which I did not mention my ethnicity.  I bristled at the suggestions from fellow employees that I got the job because of the equal opportunity provision for hiring.

wyzra,,"Affirmative action programs are created by people who stand to gain power from it. I understand how people were mistreated in the past because of their race, but affirmative action as it's implemented today isn't looking to right these wrongs.

From all my experience in higher education, affirmative action in America's colleges and universities has, as a primary or at least secondary goal, the objective to limit the amount of Asian American students for cultural reasons (the primary goal is, as usual, catering to big money interests). Affirmative action in the workplace was meant to placate riots and disrupt labor unions.

I understand that black people in America aren't on a level playing field, but I don't think the way to remedy this is to give primarily white administrators and employers the license to racially discriminate."
unkle,RIP KATHNIEL,"Today, Asian-Americans make up about 25 percent of the students at the university’s campus in Seattle, compared with about 10 percent of the state’s overall population of those aged 20 to 24. Campus populations of other minority groups lag behind their statewide numbers. African-Americans are 3 percent of the students on campus, and 5.2 percent of the state population of 20- to 24-year-olds. About 8 percent of University of Washington students are Latino, compared with a statewide population of 18 percent.

Shengquan Liang, 45, a software developer in the Seattle area who has two teenagers, said he worried that affirmative action policies would potentially make it more difficult for his children to get into the schools of their choice.

“If you want to say, ‘Let’s fix discrimination by introducing more discrimination,’ that doesn’t make sense at all,” Mr. Liang said.

But Maya Manus, an African-American law student at Seattle University, a private institution, said her time as an undergraduate at Washington State University showed her the need for such diversity efforts. She felt uncomfortable on a campus in which only 3 percent of fellow students were black, and she found the lack of diverse faculty to be a glaring problem.

Ms. Manus said improved diversity could help enhance the educational experience of all students while also helping raise up those who have been historically marginalized.

“They need to be able to have a voice at the table,” Ms. Manus said."

While you're not wrong about that, I don't think it's just about personal interest. Considering race in admissions is unpopular across all racial groups, even the groups that benefit from race-conscious admissions. It's more unpopular among whites, but something like 60% of each minority group believes race shouldn't be considered. I think most Americans perceive it (rightly or wrongly) as not being meritocratic or ""fair""."

This is partly because many of us are/were from out of state, although in-state AsAms are probably also overrepresented."
wyzra,,"A lot of it comes from my personal communication with admissions officers and deans at the university.

But it makes sense if you think about how the university operates. Harvard, for example, was taking money from Saudi Arabia and Jeffrey Epstein. They regularly give out admissions slots to the relatives of large donors. And the admissions office reports only to the fundraising part of the univeristy like the president and trustees, it has no connection to the education part. Of course, the university keeps all of this very confidential, and a full list of donors isn't available even to the ""shareholders"".

But the universities even partially admit themselves that they aren't trying to correct for disadvantage. This is part of the genius of the ""diversity rationale"" for affirmative action. The apparent justification for this blatant violation of anti-discrimination law is that having a diverse student body brings an increase in productivity or educational value. Never mind that this claim isn't solidly backed up by research and no attempt has even been made to quantify diversity. In the Harvard trial, Dean Rakesh Khurana repeatedly claimed that Harvard isn't trying to achieve socioeconomic balance in its student body. In the Texas case, Justice Alito cited University of Texas officials who claimed that their affirmative action plan was designed for the children of wealthy black professionals in Dallas, who add diversity despite having no socioeconomic disadvantages.

And this is the reason why the universities can discriminate against Asians despite our population suffering historical racial injustice (on a level comparable with Latinos, at least in this country). They claim that Asians are ""over-represented"" (which means they have a greater share in the class than the US population, ignoring the breakdown by age and the selective immigration pressures which cause Asian Americans to be disproportionately high-achieving).

If you've been to a college or university with a large Asian population (UC schools, Caltech, University of Washington, for example) you've doubtless heard students, faculty, or parents complain about there being ""too many Asians."" If you're of a certain age, you can see this in the alumni groups as well (and in the Harvard trial they produced emails of alumni directly complaining to admissions officers). So it's really no surprise that it's happening."
ALittleFly,,"In contrast to wyzra's purely anecdotal claims, you can see the historical and empirical evidence supporting affirmative action in [Asian Americans Advancing Justice's amicus brief](https://www.advancingjustice-la.org/sites/default/files/Fisher%20final%2014-981%20bsac%20AAAJ.PDF) in the Fisher (II) Supreme Court case (challenging affirmative action in the University of Texas system's admissions).

Some highlights:

>Race-conscious admissions programs played a critical role in opening the doors of public and private universities to many AAPIs in the 1960s and 1970s.9  During this time, AAPIs were designated beneficiaries of various affirmative action programs, and thus gained admission to many reputable schools.10 For example, affirmative action programs at University of California (“UC”) Davis and UC Berkeley included AAPIs among their targeted minority groups. In addition to undergraduate admissions, AAPIs were also identified beneficiaries of race-conscious admissions programs at graduate and professional schools, including law schools at UC Berkeley (formerly Boalt Hall), UCLA, and University of Washington.11 As the number of some AAPI subgroups admitted to the UC system increased, their inclusion as underrepresented groups under the race-conscious admissions programs ended.12 Yet race-conscious admissions programs at the UC’s flagship schools continued to include Filipino Americans through the 1990s.13 In fact, some public universities, such as the University of Wisconsin, continue to include AAPI subgroups, such as Southeast Asians, in their affirmative action programs today.14

>Indeed, the record indicates that UT Austin’s holistic review benefitted many AAPI individuals *with low test scores*. Even after race was added as a subfactor in holistic review in 2005, a number of AAPIs with low SAT scores were admitted through the race-conscious process. *See* SJA at 164a. Data show that at least57 53 AAPIs in 2005, 49 in 2006, and 67 in 2007 were admitted through UT Austin’s holistic review, despite having SAT scores well below the mean for UT Austin enrollees those years. Id. The highest number during this five-year period was 2007 when race *was* considered, even higher than in 2003 and 2004 when race was *not* considered. *Id.* This undercuts any suggestion that AAPI applicants are (1) “excluded” from benefitting from UT Austin’s holistic review, or (2) categorically “burdened” by being required to achieve substantially higher SAT scores than their non-AAPI peers.

>*First*, there is no evidence of a decrease in the number of AAPI total admits after the inclusion of race in UT Austin’s holistic review in 2005. *See* SJA at 156a. No overall shortfall exists between AAPI *applications* on the one hand, and *admissions* or *enrollment* on the other hand, that would support a claim of discrimination against AAPIs. *See* SJA at 43a, 156a. Between 1996 and 2008, AAPI students consistently comprised 14-15% of all freshman applicants at UT Austin. *See id*. AAPI students comprised 14-18% of all freshmen admits, with the highest percentages in that range occurring *after* UT Austin began considering race in 2005 and allegedly began penalizing AAPIs. *Id.* During that same period, AAPI  students comprised 15-20% of all enrolled freshmen. Id. Because admission and enrollment of AAPIs did not drop after the introduction of UT Austin’s race conscious admissions program in 2005, there is no support for the claim that race-conscious admissions disproportionately “burdened” AAPIs.58 *See* AALF Br. at 9.  
>  
>*Second*, there was no dip in the number of AAPI holistic admits attributable to the inclusion of race in 2005. *See* SJA at 157a. UT Austin’s holistic review admitted and enrolled comparable percentages of AAPIs before *and* after the inclusion of race in 2005.59 *See id*. In fact, the percentage of enrolled students  admitted through the holistic process after 2005 who are AAPI exceeds those who are Hispanic. *See id*. (18% of holistic enrollees in 2005 were AAPI compared to 13% who were Hispanic). This is true even though the number of Hispanic total admits started to exceed the number of AAPI total admits in 2005. See SJA at 156a.  
>  
>And contrary to the claim that holistic review imposes higher SAT thresholds on AAPIs, the number of AAPI holistic admits *with below-average SAT scores* did not plummet after the inclusion of race in 2005:  \[graphs in the brief\]. Whether measured as a percentage of all AAPI holistic admits, or as a percentage of all holistic admits with below-average SAT scores, the fact is that AAPIs (including those with below-average SAT scores) were not suddenly winnowed out with the inclusion of race in 2005.  
>  
>*Third*, Petitioner’s *amici* point to the “test score gap” between *mean* AAPI SAT scores and those of other groups as evidence of discriminatory intent. Conceptually, mean SAT scores by race do not reveal how individual applicants are treated. Practically, the record demonstrates that any “test score gap” existed well *before* UT Austin began considering race in 2005. *See* SJA at 49a-53a (showing differential test score averages between races from 1996 through 2005). This gap also existed in Top 10% admissions, which does *not* consider race as a factor in admission decisions. *Id.* 62 This conclusively demonstrates that any “test score gap” was not *caused* or *increased* by holistic review.  
>  
>UT Austin’s track record is consistent with nationwide data, which indicates that AAPI *applicants* as a group generally have higher average SAT   scores than applicants from other racial groups.63 Any “test score gap” begins with the starting applicant pool, before any admissions decision is made. While the structural forces contributing to differences in the applicant pool are complex, *see supra* Section II.C, it cannot be said that the root cause of any disparities lies in any subsequent admissions process.64 Where *none* of the aforementioned data support Petitioner and her *amici’s* claims that holistic admissions disproportionately hurts AAPIs, those claims must be rejected.

,,"Wow thanks for actually following up with info, are there any older cases pre aa you know of that set any things in motion?"
ALittleFly,,"No problem! By older cases, are you referring to older Supreme Court cases pre-affirmative action that addressed the issue? If so, none I can think of off the top of my head. Before affirmative action, most of the lawsuits were focused on just getting in the front door in the first place (i.e. Brown v. Board of Education).    


If we're talking affirmative action through policy, the practice probably originates in the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, where many laws were passed specifically to aid black Americans whom had been newly liberated from slavery.  (See [Jed Rubenfeld, Affirmative Action, Yale Law Journal](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2562&context=fss_papers)). However, post-war efforts could only stand against southern resentment and northern impatience for so long, and the tide soon turned against black Americans with the passage of the so-called black codes, and later, Jim Crow laws, that severely restricted their rights. The notorious [Civil Rights Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases) were a sad emblem of this regression in time, when the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law because the Court was tired of affirmative action:  


> When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitants of that state, there must be some stage in the progress of his elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen, and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws, and when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected in the ordinary modes by which other men's rights are protected. There were thousands of free colored people in this country before the abolition of slavery, enjoying all the essential rights of life, liberty, and property the same as white citizens; yet no one, at that time, thought that it was any invasion of their personal status as freemen because they were not admitted to all the privileges enjoyed by white citizens, or because they were subjected to discriminations in the enjoyment of accommodations in inns, public conveyances, and places of amusement. Mere discriminations on account of race or color were not regarded as badges of slavery . . .

Of course, the Court was wrong to dismiss the ""mere discriminations"" of people because of their race or to assume that the racism baked into slavery, and its debilitation of racial minorities, suddenly vanished with the passage of time. But that was the dominant mindset in America for a long time. Things started changing in the 1900s with FDR and WW2. The term ""affirmative action"" itself appears to have originated in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, and continued through FDR's executive order requiring defense contractors to apply affirmative action in hiring (which FDR was prompted to sign after many civil rights advocates and protesters pointed out that black Americans were dying for a country that continued to treat them as second-class citizens).   Subsequent presidents from both parties continued to build on this practice.  Apparently, the initial consideration of affirmative action in education dealt with cases enforcing the ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (holding racial segregation in schools unconstitutional), and efforts to combat de facto segregation through white flight. (See [Jackie Mansky, ""The Origins of the Term 'Affirmative Action,'"" Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/learn-origins-term-affirmative-action-180959531/)).  


Asian Americans don't appear in this fight for awhile, mainly because a lot of Asian Americans were simply kept out through the [Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) (it was later expanded to exclude all East Asians), which was only removed in 1965.  Asian Americans did play a prominent role in protests in the late 1960s demanding that universities, among other things, establish ethnic study programs, hire minority professors, and recruit students from the ghettos.

This is far different than the cycle of poverty and violence that plagues many black and latino communities. My fiancé teaches in the Bronx where a lot of the kids are from families literally living out of homeless shelters. No stability, a single parent working full-time, the other parent a victim of America's brutally racist justice system.

To me, someone who's applying for college from that background has come up far more than your average Asian two-parent stable household (I generalize because the two parent gap is huge between the two cohorts I mentioned). 

To me, dismissing such factors for raw ""socio-economics"" (whatever that means) is equivalent to Donald Trump saying all he had to do to get ahead was getting a small million dollar loan from his dad.

Thousands of words to get to a pitiful conclusion. How do any of these ""solutions"" actually prevent discrimination if it doesn't fundamentally change how the personality score is determined and used? 

People who put out the position that the Harvard case is not a binary one are really grasping at straws.

lolamerica00,,"The real problem isn't really AA. It's that top schools want to artificially keep their white population higher than it otherwise would be. They need to admit the children of alumni and donors, most of whom are white. And in order to do this without reducing the Latino/Black population they have to limit the Asian population. In Ivies in like the last 10-15 years the Asian population has barely increased even though our share of the US population and high end applicants has greatly increased. 

I wish people wouldn't blame AA. The real problem is legacy admissions and the need for top schools to admit the children of rich whites. Admissions offices are also likely full of whites and they don't want their campus to become majority Asian. "
,,"Asian students have to work much, MUCH harder to *differentiate themselves* than other students. In the past 10 years application rates have skyrocketed and each new year is a record breaker but obviously the schools can't suddenly admit that much more people due to space/staff constraints. So the result is that everyone has to really prove they're special enough to snag a seat, but since admissions committees throttle the population by race it creates problems for Asians. They can no longer set hard race quotas after that one UC Berkeley v. someone Supreme Court case, but they are permitted to maintain more general percentages or ratios that don't predict demographics down to each individual student.

Now, say that you want a student body that's roughly 50% white, 20% Asian, 15% Black, and 15% Hispanic. You're a liberal arts institution, so you suppress the amount of STEM applicants in the name of holistic whatever: split between 60% humanities and 40% STEM. You want to maintain the same race ratios in each subject but that's less of a priority than overall student body diversity.

Your applicants are 50% white, 45% Asian, and 5% anybody else. And almost all of the 45% Asians is trying to apply as a STEM major. 

Do you see how this turns into a massive clusterfuck? People tend to forget about the fact that majors will have a big impact on admissions, depending on whether a school is trying to build up X department or reduce research costs or just has too many impacted majors and can't handle the load. The fact that most Asian students are going into STEM, particularly the ""hot"" fields (biochem and computer science) really can't be separated from our race because it's born out of financial insecurity in our immigrant parents' lives and their resulting preferences for a more ""guaranteed"" career. But it plays a huge role in making admissions harder.

We haven't even gotten to the actual applications yet. At this stage it's just the little boxes you tick off on the Common Application that gets sent to every school. 

Beyond this, there's lots of subjective essays that are aimed to display a student's individuality and ~leadership skills~ and a slot for your resume. Most Ivies also ask you about which books you liked reading, and what museums/cultural events you've gone to in the past year. Some schools want you to upload a picture of your face. And of course, there's interviews. This process is what makes ""holistic"" admissions *holistic.* The goal is to look beyond numbers and find the student's true passion and love for learning. 

When racist non-Asian admissions officers go into this process with stereotypes about Asian people the results are...not great. Statements and profiles that would look stunning on a white applicant or be interpreted as some deep lesson/feel-good story from a non-Asian PoC are assumed to be fabricated or insincere coming out of an Asian student. Topics that would make good essays (anti-Asian racism, being the child of immigrants, family memories) are dismissed as malicious attempts to get pity points.

The stereotype of the Asian as a soulless worker bee with no desires beyond money and procreation runs directly counter to the ideal of a warm, community-integrated student that holistic admissions is hunting for. No matter how much they want to hide it, the wealthy white liberals running these colleges still believe deep down that Asian people and white people have irreconcilably different value systems and it fucking hurts them to see us on ""their"" campuses, learning ""their"" curricula. This is why they ask about books and museums: they want you to prove that you're receptive to Western media and that you'll allow them to colonize your definitions of art and beauty. The fact that a lot of Asian students are in STEM makes this somewhat easier for them: they can draw a line between cute white philosopher-kings reading Kant and Balzac, and bottom-feeder chinks who just want to press buttons and get a paycheck, without getting any kind of retaliation from racist Americans. 

Of course, there's nothing wrong with studying Western books, or studying organs. Double majoring allows a lot of people to do both.  The problem is when you start forcing Asian students to do a whole song and dance to prove that their plans aren't an existential threat to white people's egos. 

And honestly? AA is not the shining crown jewel of American egalitarianism. This is ostensibly a program for Black and Latino students, but it ends up benefiting [white girls](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action) the most. It claims to welcome PoC with open arms and then makes us fight each other for a few opportunities while white people's admittance is taken for granted. There's a reason why this story has captivated Americans so much despite the fact that it doesn't affect that many students irl: it's a race war tamed down into a game, a spectacle that white people can gleefully watch from the sidelines. It's gratifying and validating to watch for non-Asians that feel threatened by our presence. It turns Asian people into a show that people can tune into and then throw away. 

TL;DR It's a combination of inconvenient number games and just straight up racism, and don't trust people who defend AA from Asian criticism by blaming it on greedy Chinese people with no vision for the future. Those people fell for the whole ""white supremacist rhetoric is OK if it's about Asians"" BS that non-Asian liberals love so much.

,,"Affirmative Action is a loincloth that covers up deeper issue of inadequate primary and secondary education as well as socioeconomic condition in POC communities, it is a temporary Band-Aid that somehow became permanent solution.

Asian are affected because the system is racially based does not account specific challenges by the Asian communities, essentially the same factor still affects Asian except 1) Asian immigrants are often already educated (often at the expense of their home countries. i.e. Brain Drain), thus allows for supplemental home schooling . 2) The presence and usage of supplemental schooling such as Kumon that evens out inadequate public schools. 3) The immigrant generate are able to afford housings in predominantly white school districts.

For asians that does not enjoy these benefits (and they are many, from Chinese restaurant kids to Vietnamese refugee communities), they both being punished for both havinf to go to sub-par schools as well as being discriminated against in the application process."

ZOOMj,,"I used to be adamantly opposed to AA but now I'm not entirely sure. There is no doubt AA harms Asian-Americans and I think that economic situation should carry greater weight than race. But at the same time, there is clear and convincing evidence that there is still systemic racism against the races that AA is supposed to benefit. 

The one that stands out to me the most is the study where they sent out two resumes to thousands of job listings. The resumes were exactly the same except one had a white sounding name and one had a black sounding name. The resume with the black sounding name got significantly less responses. I mean, how do you deal with this? It's so complicated. AA is a crude and imperfect way to deal with this kind of ingrained racism. I don't really have a satisfactory answer (or even personal position). Just kinda my thoughts."
sylocheed,,"A few questions for thought I'll throw out:

1) If affirmative action was something that once helped Asian Pacific Americans (""APA""), but no longer, is it really fair for APAs to ""pull up the ladder"" behind them?  Abandon a progressive policy just because they're done with it?  What about all the rhetoric used before about how good it was? 

2) Affirmative Action isn't just about education even though that's the biggest deal for many.  Affirmative action exists and existed for the workplace, the hiring of government contract work, etc.  APAs are certainly not universally well represented in all industries and at the top echelons of business.  Are APAs really ready to suggest that somehow this group has achieved true equality and that there are no barriers anymore so that they can abandon political support for Affirmative Action?

3) Since when did getting into the ""best"" schools your grades afford take primacy over all other entrance considerations?  Honestly, anyone that's an adult knows that getting into your second, third, or fourth ranked school will not have any negative impact on your professional future.  It's the grades you make, the activities you pursue, and the connections that you make that are ultimately important.  

4) Why isn't Diversity a key value for schools in and of itself?  The reason there are such shitty terribly racist things that slip into the media is because there wasn't diversity at the decision making level.  When someone at Abercrombie & Fitch decided to run a bunch of racist t-shirts, there was no Asian person that could be like, uh, no that's fucked up and here's why. Just as it's incumbent upon leaders to fill his advisers with some dissent, diversity in backgrounds and ideas (of all kinds, not just race) is critical.  In addition, for some reason it makes sense that we want musicians, athletes, artists, veterans, etc. and factor those things into the application process--schools based purely on what SAT score one got will yield a very one-dimensional student body.  Why isn't ethnic or racial background a legitimate basis for this?
"
,,"This is an issue I feel can be completely resolved if we answer the following questions: 

1. Admissions offices: How well can they assay applicants?
2. Minority underrepresentation: What are the causes?

Ideally, admissions offices admit students based solely on their merits. In other words, on the basis of how intellectual a student is, how ambitious, and how socially adjusted.   

But can you do that just by looking at some grades, an essay, a list of activities, and a recommendation? We AAs are generally good at perfecting our applications because they're largely based on objective goals that can be solved by brute force, dedication, and money (SAT school, studying all the time, sucking up to teachers, etc.). Intellectualism and leadership optional, honestly. I feel as if admissions offices are becoming increasingly privy to this, and in my personal experience many AA in the top universities do not flourish as leaders and intellectuals, simply continuing their pursuit of objective academic & professional goals.  

On the other hand, there may be a black or Native American student who has much potential as an intellectual or leader, but has been afforded little opportunity to cultivate these attributes due to their shitty environment at home (e.g. they're poor so they have to work a job, or they've been locked down by racism, etc.). 

So how do admissions offices respond? Using a rather ineloquent solution: racial quotas. They're assuming all of the blacks, women, and other underrepresented minorities they admit on basis of their minority-ness and *not* those objective measures (i.e. SAT, grades, recs) have potential as intellectuals and leaders. I can tell you this isn't true all the time.   

And as a side note, affirmative action has the unfortunate effect of the upper echelons of the international Black community (i.e. rich Africans, rich Black Americans, etc.) are admitted *so* easily it's not even funny, even if they have little intellectual/leadership merit. They're rich enough, they could have definitely cultivated those values. So in the end, *at least* some of the time affirmative action doesn't even help those it it was designed to help: the poor who were not afforded any opportunities. 

Back to those two questions. 

1. If admissions offices can perfectly see how much potential an applicant has, which admittedly is a damn hard task, then they wouldn't have to revert to affirmative action, which many take unfair advantage of (the unqualified, and the rich minorities). EDIT: and Asians that *actually* are intellectual or leaders would be admitted, not just the ones that brute forced their way in by polishing their application.

2. If minority underrepresentation is caused by a lack of opportunities, then we need to fix that *before* college admissions. Improve education at the elementary and high school levels, and let the smartest be given every opportunity as the rich (read: Asians) have. And at the risk of sounding xenophobic, if underrepresentation is caused by their ethnic culture (e.g. a lack of ambition, a hatred of intellectualism), then that's that and that minority will just be underrepresented at the end of the day.

,,"Affirmative action was meant to right past historic wrongs.

In the past college/universities deliberately target minorities for exclusion. AA was designed to force integration and give minorities a chance where before they virtually had none. It was designed to fight institutional racism.

I agree in theory, but like how I feel about Libertarianism for political/economic policy, the theory has little relationship with the reality.  The problem here is that it is easy for opponents of affirmative action to pay lip service to the idea that we need to fundamentally reform and level the K-12 playing field, in arguing that Affirmative Action should be stopped.  However, do you really think they are willing to put their money where their mouth is?  Are the opponents really ready to make the kinds of investments and divert the right kind of budget and resources to leveling the playing field?  

**fuck no.**

What will happen is that you get rid of affirmative action, and then leave the broken k-12 system as is where some students get great educations, and some get terrible ones, and you've taken what is admittedly, the only broken, poor band-aid off of the public education system bleeding.

Lastly, I'd add that your well-constructed argument addresses only one of the reasons that Affirmative Action exists-the group restitution theory of affirmative action.

>I honestly do believe there is a strong ""diversity"" and ""role model"" benefit to Affirmative Action as well that I'll get into if people actually care to hear.

Diversity? What does that mean in the context of a university? In my view, the role of the university is to advance human knowledge, and to apply knowledge in improving the human condition. I know many people think otherwise; that a university is an institution that trains high school seniors into productive and upstanding citizens. In that case, this is a distinctly different debate. In institutions that emphasizes undergraduate education (such as state schools or liberal arts colleges), then sure, it makes sense to expose equal numbers of ethnic groups as a way to condition non-racist behavior in our future citizens. Role models have a similar goal; i.e. providing impetus for young men and women to also become productive citizens. 

In other words, I think your points about fostering 'diversity' and the 'role model' benefit is a different issue than the one I am addressing. It is contrary to the goal of a university because quotas *will*, by definition, allow the less-than-qualified to enter and muck up the works. In an ideal world, let diversity be established naturally by fairly 'electing' the best and brightest as they come, regardless of ethnic group (which is no easy task, as I stated in my initial post). If that means ethnicities will be represented in proportions not representative of the entire population, for whatever reason, then so be it. Those who *are* present are there based on their ability to advance human knowledge and improve the human condition (intellectualism+leadership), not the color of their skin, their genitals, or what they do on December 25th.

In that case, this is a distinctly different debate.

That is well-articulated and fair, although I would make the diversity case that still exists under this university objective.  I'll first assume that you're not limiting the kinds of scholarship you're referring to--the vast body of liberal arts and social sciences, fields like psychology, political science, anthropology, etc., are benefitted when those with diverse viewpoints contribute to that body of scholarship.  Whites or males may simply, by virtue of privilege not be aware of or interested in cutting-edge race and gender questions.  Furthermore, history is replete with examples of where Whites have made the wrong necessary assumptions or have certain beliefs that result in poor studies/social science.  And, even if your view were to exclude the social sciences from this kind of scholarship, the same is true of many of the hard sciences.  Granted, things like math and physics have nothing to do with race or gender, biology certainly does, and again our history is rife with experiments that presumed a male-only model or a Whites-only model to the detriment of science.  This is also not to say our history is rife with the improper experimentation of non-Whites as well.

I argue that even with the sole goal of advancing scholarship, a pure meritocracy does not yield the best scholarship.  Diversity (along with metrics not easily objectively tested like management skills) speak to the idea that a single-mindedness towards taking an uncritical ""top X percent"" of some test taker is not an ideal method.
"
,,">Whites or males may simply, by virtue of privilege not be aware of or interested in cutting-edge race and gender questions.

This is a valid point, and one I thought about when writing my reply. Which is why I included the ""in an ideal world"" disclaimer. But yes, I realize it's a real problem reflective of underlying racism and ethnocentrism in Western society, and one I suspect could be solved as we progress in building an egalitarian culture and attitude. I don't know the best way of doing this. It could involve affirmative action, or it could not (do the ends justify the downsides we are seeing now?). Social policy is tricky. 


> Diversity (along with metrics not easily objectively tested like management skills) speak to the idea that a single-mindedness towards taking an uncritical ""top X percent"" of some test taker is not an ideal method.

In my initial comment, I emphasized test scores are not a complete measure, by any means, of gauging one's potential for 'intellectualism'. That's what they should be searching for (not necessarily the top % of a test score). Now, the following is a personal belief of mine, and you may or may not share it, but I firmly believe the endeavors of intellectualism (the humanities and the sciences both) are, in their purest form, performed without reference to the performer. While it is true one's background often dictates one's interest, as a whole *good* and progressive works of science and in the humanities contain objectively valid truths. And there are none other than the best and brightest (and no, this does not mean everyone who scored over 2300 on the SAT, which many could do given time and money) that are effective at building these objectively valid truths. 

Now, the top universities are filled up with many who do not fit the criteria for being a thinker or leader. Nepotism, fiscal concerns in the admissions office, affirmative action, and legacy admits all contribute to campuses filled with backward thinking, and yes, racist & self-segregating students. I'm talking Harvard, Yale, Princeton. By contrast, in my personal experience I've found that those admitted on bases of their intellectual capacity are often the kindest, most reasonable, and un-racist people I've met. (This isn't true for everyone, of course. But it certainly tends to be the case). It seems enlightenment succeeds xenophobia, quite unsurprisingly.

I'd wager a vastly improved, holistic admissions policy looking for such intellectuals could eliminate many of the problems of racism/ethnocentrism we see today. Not filling racial quotas, and letting the unqualified slip through the cracks."

Also, [affirmative action is already banned in California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_209), where most Asian American live.

Affirmative action is more about the clash of interests of different minority groups: i.e., Asians vs Hispanics.  It hurts us but helps them, so we are against it and they are for it.  Everyone is looking out for their own interests, as it should be.  BTW, the key people who fought back against the attempt to bring back affirmative action and killed it were Asian *Democrat* representatives.

I am sure Hispanics will try again to bring back affirmative action in California.  I had thought Asians will lose the affirmative action in the long run because Hispanics have a much bigger population - and therefore more political clout than Asians in America.  So I expect them to try and try again until they finally get what they want.  But then I read that [Asians have overtaken Hispanics as the largest immigrant groups](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/15/asian-immigrants-surpass-hispanics_n_3446441.html), and our population in California will catch up with and overtake Hispanics in our lifetime, (likely in another twelve to fifteen years if the current immigration trend continues.)

It's just interesting the people who support us on this issue. People can't honestly think they're fighting white supremacy when the Trump Administration has decided to weigh in and back the AA plaintiffs. I saw a great tweet that stated asian activism is dominated by east asians who are focused on dismantling stereotypes and not anything institutional because they value their proximity to whiteness/the upper class. The one time they do go against anything institutional is when they feel their proximity to whiteness via ivy leagues is being threatened and they are totally willing to throw other brown people under the bus to uphold that. I think the Harvard case is an encapsulation of what Asian american politics is about, the anger that we are not allowed to be white like we thought we could. indulging in anti blackness only wins us their praise to a point. They interviewed a bunch of anti Affirmative action Asians for an article and most of them genuinely thought America wasn't racist, until it came to this. "
shittyrocks,,"I think you bring up some good and interesting points. Regardless of which side of affirmative action or this harvard case one stands on, I think most people in this community do not like how this case is lead by Blum and only exist because he lost his first case with Fisher. 

I am not sure which tweet you are referring to, but for the most part, I agree with you especially in fields and industries that are highly sought after and that currently have low Asian representation like media, literature, and higher education. For both the conservative Asians and liberal Asians, there is a lot of using Asian activism when it is convenient while upholding the status quo.

With that said, affirmative action is typically associated with race, and many people including Blum and his associates probably think of it as a race issue. However, I think Asians especially East Asians see it as a barrier to a top tier education. Right or wrong, for better or worse, education (especially an ivy league-ish education) is more central and more important to East Asians than most groups. If you listen to some of the comments from Harvard and their critiques of Asian applicants are pretty nasty and very arbitrary in determining low schools. It was pretty much that you got a low score for behaving like a ""stereotypical Asian"" and liking stereotypical Asian stuff.

Do colleges know what they want in a student?  Overall, it's a business that wants as much customers and revenue as possible.  

1.  Many minority students that are accepted drop out their first year with 40k + in debt, and the college doesn't care b/c it get spaid from fafsa and lets the 19 year old sucker deal with the debt. 
 
2.  The overall issue is that the education system from high school and college needs an overhaul to best fit everyone.  

3.  Concerning meritocracy, it can work for students who know what they want to study, then applicants can be analyzed and compared if entrance is limited.  
For students who don't know what they want to do in life and only apply b/c ""It's a good school"" are being mislead.  Many high school environments are to blame (Pick a safety school, middle of the road, reach schools) all so they can have bragging rights and promote their high school for which colleges their students have been accepted to.  What high schools don't tell you, is how much fluff or pressure goes into assigning student grades or recommendations, or pushy parents  It's a sick game.    

4.  A.Action is more of a concern for Top Tier Ivy or U.C school systems, b/c everyone wants that school, that recognition, bragging rights, status.  That's the problem, b/c education becomes business: who you know and what you do with them is more important than what you know.  

5.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2677079/You-think-I-dont-cops-Drunken-NYU-student-shames-cringe-worthy-viral-video-claiming-family-owns-half-Manhattan-dont.html
How does this little sh$% get into NYU?  
If A.Action looks at the whole person, personal ethics should be a major criteria determining acceptance, not race percentages. 

6.  I think I answered my own question: even starting in high school parents ask: what does the school offer?  How successful are the kids?  Even for NYC public schools, to a certain extent parents can choose their kids' high school.  So the school has a lot of pressure to give the b.s that the parents want to hear.  More students enroll, more federal, state, and city taxpayer money to that school.  
Administration pressures teachers, guidance counselors to make the students and school look good.  The same thing runs at the college level, b/c no enrollment, no money.  This is why American college students are trillions of dollars in debt.  Panic induced debt starting from high school or earlier.

7.  It's good money, so whoever's making money, hires lobbyists to lobby their agenda in Washington, confuse me and you with their public relations, getting minorities and Whites to blame each other for pigeon holding each other, scrambling to compete for imagined scarce resource of a good college.    

8.  Don't get me wrong, there are some colleges and high schools that offer fair value for their students, or only for specific majors, however, there are many parents, teachers, and students who hate this entire system and wish they had freedom not to be tied to it.   
   

"
rrigby1,,"I agree with a lot of what you wrote.  There are a lot of issues in play here.  You've mentioned a lot of them, including the nature of universities, the business vs. public service argument, how ""interventionist"" or ""meritocratic"" an admission committee should be, and/or the personal character of the applicant. 

My understanding of affirmative action is that it applies only to the public sector.  So for education, this would apply to public universities, secondary schools, but private schools like Yale or Harvard would not fall under the affirmative action umbrella and they would be free to admit any students of their choosing.  Ivies have their own controversies in admissions, including something known as legacy admissions, which is pretty much the exact opposite end of the spectrum of affirmative action. 

California banned affirmative action in the 90's with passage Prop 209.  My understanding of the UC admissions is that it is a combination of meritocratic and holistic.  People that score below the threshold can still make it into a UC, if their extracurriculars are positive.  Of course, to get into the best UCs, you need to both score well and have positive extracurriculars. Personal character is usually judged via the personal statement, and sometimes interviews if you're eligible for a scholarship. 

California's SCA5 sought to overturn the public education aspects of Prop 209, re-instating affirmative action.  Huge opposition from Chinese parents caused it to be tabled, I believe.  Oddly enough, there was initial support from state senators Leland Yee, Ted Lieu, and Carol Liu.  You have to remember that affirmative action would typically be applied to areas outside of education too, but SCA5 was limited to just public education.  In other words, it impacted Asian Americans negatively in multiple dimensions.  I don't know exactly what's going on with the state senators and the Asian American advocacy organizations, but I find it just so very strange.  I tend to believe these politicians/orgs were bought out or they're asleep at the wheel, but I really don't know.

For a different perspective, [here's](http://blog.angryasianman.com/2014/03/hate-fear-and-lies-how-anti-affirmative.html) a blog article on SCA5. 

Universities are definitely getting much costlier, especially the private ones.  This is why public education is important and why affirmative action for college admissions is such a hot button issue. "
HeWhoisNosy,,"I see Oi Yan Pooh perspective.  PC correct, played it, and universally appealing.

I believe your UC system like every other social institution is a limited resource.  Taxpayer dollars are also a limited resource.  Everyone wants more funding.

I disagree with the article b/c people will hustle and tell any sob story or fluff up their success to get more benefits from the system.  Especially if a student writes a good college essay.  

At my high school, the guidance counselor(s) and English teachers require and help students write their college essays vs. others do not.  Who gets a tremendous leg up if your English teacher is helping you write a persuasive essay?

And from the college end, if college admissions are watered down whether due to A.Action, college professors have to water down the material.  
There are a lot of articles floating around how college students enter the college without basic fundamentals of writing or mathematics.  

Having gone through the SUNY system, it's a waste of motivated students' time having to take required gen. ed. classes with non-motivated students.  
  
More funding to the public systems will not help.  It will most likely be unregulated, wasteful, and misspent.  "
rrigby1,,"> I believe your UC system like every other social institution is a limited resource. Taxpayer dollars are also a limited resource. Everyone wants more funding.

This what I believe as well, and this is why I believe that college admissions is ultimately zero-sum.  There's a limited amount of professors, teaching assistants, money, hours, apartments, you-name-it.  Those that say it is positive-sum are only correct in a limited frame of reference.  

I also believe the ones that are most adversely affected by affirmative action are the ""poor"" Asians, the ones that ironically enough are most likely to support affirmative action.  Here's why:  All things being equal, a university is more likely to choose the applicant that can pay their way, rather than the one that needs financial assistance.  Asian admissions as a whole will almost certainly decline (in the name of ""diversity""), and the ones left in the cold will be the ones that somehow believe they will be beneficiaries of the system. 

You can only have social justice if there was social injustice in the first place.  And I have hard time believing that a meritocratic system is unjust.  I also have just as hard of a time understanding why the qualified Asian student should give up his seat to a non-Asian in the name of diversity.  If there are Asians that are supportive of this sort of social engineering, they should voluntarily give up their own seats, rather than support a system that mandates that fellow Asians do so and is also likely to be *more* unjust than its predecessor. 

I actually think one of the most interesting cases regarding affirmative action is [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-clarence-thomas-grew-to-hate-affirmative-action-2013-10) one regarding Clarence Thomas.

two,,"Let me preface this by saying I am in favor of affirmative action, although I believe economics-based discrimination is preferable to affirmative action.

>**Myth #1: Affirmative action discriminates against Asians.**

>Asians aren't victims of affirmative action programs. Studies have shown that AAPIs are harmed by ""negative action,"" which is not the same as affirmative action. Negative action is when AAPIs are held to a higher standard than Caucasians, without any legitimate reason.

What does the author think causes ""negative action""? It's simple math. If you add, artificially, to column A, you have to remove, artificially, from column B. And how do you do this? By holding column B to a higher standard.

>Opponents of affirmative action ignore history when they claim that Asians have been harmed by affirmative action in higher education.

I'm not sure anyone says this. The question is whether it harms Asians *now* - not in the 60s or 70s. I'm not sure that any argument against affirmative action is based on harm to Asians half a century ago.

>Opponents of affirmative action also argue that considering race compromises merit. But merit comes in many forms and grades and test scores aren't everything.

Race, on the other hand, is all about merit.

>**Myth #2: Affirmative action doesn't benefit Asian Americans.**

>AAPIs and all students benefit from being educated in diverse learning environments, which affirmative action programs help create. AAPIs are harmed when they attend schools that are less racially diverse and more segregated.

*...how?* This is so unbelievably paternalistic. ""What you want is not important. You *need* diversity, and we need to look out for *your* best interests by providing you with that diversity.

>**Myth #3: We live in a colorblind society and no longer need affirmative action.**

Said no one (of any relevance) ever.

>**Myth #4: Affirmative action helped Asian Americans in the past, but now Asian Americans don't need it.**

She then proceeds to concur with this ""myth,"" instead offering that we cannot ""only support programs when they benefit us."" I happen to agree. However, even if Asian Americans still ""need[ed]"" affirmative action, the simple fact of the matter is that affirmative action, in its present incarnation, discriminates *against* Asian Americans, so the argument is moot.

>**Myth #5: Asians support the end of affirmative action.**

I think it goes both ways. Asians are individuals, not some sort of monolith that supports one thing or another.

>**So Asians, please don't hate on affirmative action. It does our society good!**

I think so too! But that was not the premise of the article at all! Don't argue that affirmative action (1) does not harm and (2) in fact helps Asians out of one side of your mouth, and then proceed to argue out of the other side of your mouth that although affirmative action (1) harms and (2) does not help Asians, it does society as a whole more good than harm. I agree with the latter argument. However, I just lose it when people try to argue it both ways, as here. It's intellectually dishonest, and intellectually lacking.

Additionally, you have schools like Caltech with race-blind admissions and their Asian American enrollment actually tracks the growth of college-age Asian Americans (as opposed to other top schools where Asian enrollment is roughly flat).

It really depends on what program you're looking at. In the most recent case, [Fisher v. UT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas), the Court dealt w/ a system that didn't consider Asian Americans as a minority race. This is, as I believe, due to the fact of racial balancing, i.e., looking at the race of Asian Americans in the school and matching that w/ the population of Asian Americans in Texas. (Note: This is my belief, but the Court has said that racial balancing may be unconstitutional. [See Parents Involved](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_908)). That being said, one of the requirements the Court has stated is that there needs to be reviews of whether or not to implement Affirmative Action programs. I believe in the UT case it was five years. So where am I going at with this? Asian American may not benefit from Affirmative Action in the UT case, but I'm sure at other schools where there are few Asian Americans, affirmative action actually helps them. Again, it depends on which program you look at.

There is also requirements from the Court to ensure that the Admissions office get together to see if race should still be used as a factor.

There share some similarities with the extreme north-western India, but for most South Asians, particularly South Indians, they are far too alien to be racially representative.

I think the closest comparisons are:

* Europe vs Turkey

I'm Indian myself and I strongly disagree. Both Pakistan and India have different racial groups within themselves. 

Pakistanis from most populous areas like Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad are the EXACT SAME RACE as Indians, and even have families split across the borders.

Now, SOME Pakistani groups come from tiny pockets in Himalayas or Iranian border and these people may look more caucasian, but even in India, similar groups exist across Kashmir, Himachal and Punjab. However, these groups are smaller in numbers, and the majority bulk of people are the exact same race with the same genetic lineage, the only difference being religion.

Lastly, Middle-Easterners and Pakistanis look very different from one another, to the point where Middle-Easterners are themselves racist towards Pakistanis because of their darker skin-tone. Middle-Easterners are closer to Caucasian, and Pakistanis are close to Indian."
readysetgoh,Chinese American,"I'm not arguing they are/aren't the same race, but the previous poster is. IIRC they used to be the same country or region but split due to religious reasons. However, that is an area I'm not completely knowledgeable in and won't pretend that I am.

2) The majority of racism I experience is either from Pakistanis or related to Pakistanis. We don't have any cultural or racial similarities whatsoever. And genetically, they're better of in the Middle East and in South Asia.

3) It's not Islamophobic because a lot of Bangladeshi people will agree too.

4) It's racist to use Pakistanis to represent South Asians. They aren't representitive of South Asians like North Indians are; they divide the Indian community into North/South, Muslim/Hindu, etc...; they are too few cultural similarities with South Asia to be helpful; and they're one of the most racist minorities for South Asians, if not the most racist.

Pakistanis are desperate to be classified as ""Indian"" due to our better socio-economic status, and a dislike of being Muslim and Middle Eastern."
sendoutthetruth,,"There was a Middle Eastern empire that stretched from Persia to Central India; then the British came along and took most of that empire + southern India. 

Sri Lanka and Maldives were taken by the Portuguese, so were never part of the English definition of ""British India"" ( which included countries like Qatar and Myanmar too).

'Pakistan-Bangladesh' split from 'British India' due to Islamic nationalism, Bangladesh then split from Pakistan due to the differences in culture. Indian isn't an ethno-nationality; Chinese people live in North-East India, and Nepal/Bhutan are considered part of South Asia.

The United Nations includes countries as *Middle Eastern* as ""IRAN"" in ""South Asia"", but it doesn't mean both countries are part of the same race: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_geoscheme_for_Asia

It's heartbreaking that they assume they are competing in a purely merit based system like in most countries in the world, and then it turns out their racial identity, which they have no way of changing, is being used against them in the US. And used in favor of some other group (preferential treatment). 

It doesn't help that Asians are one of the smallest groups in national politics, so they do not have a lot of voting power compared to the groups that are afforded preferential treatment.

GoHiroki,,"Here's some of the results from Social Sciences Literature on the effect of Affirmative Action on Asians: 

""Admission Preferences for Minority Students, Athletes, and Legacies at Elite Universities,"" T.J. Espenshade, C.Y. Chung, and J.L. Walling, Social Science Quarterly, December 2004, 85(5):1422-1446. 

- Allegations of discriminatory admission policies against Asian-American applicants at elite universities led to compliance reviews by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights in the late 1980s at Harvard and the University of California–Berk- eley (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1992). Rising proportions of Asian Americans in applicant pools were not fully reflected in the composition of admitted students, and there were concerns that Asian Americans were being squeezed out by preferences for African-American and Hispanic applicants,

- By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission— on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.

- Average scores for applicants in each race/ethnic group are as follows: white (1347), African American (1202), Hispanic (1230), Asian (1363), and other races (1322). ... The Asian disadvantage also strengthens when controlling for SAT score, because Asian students as a group have the highest average scores.

- The odds of being accepted if one is in the top SAT category are 200 times as great as those for candidates from the bottom SAT group. African-American applicants receive the largest race/ ethnic preference (by a factor of 5.5 over whites) followed by Hispanics. Asians experience the greatest disadvantage in admissions vis-a`-vis other comparable racial/ethnic groups, including those of other races. The odds of admission for Asians are nearly 30 percent lower than those of their white counterparts.

Firstly, i'm going to have to familiarize myself with the spreads of SAT scores before i draw a judgement from this. Also, my impression before doing that legwork is that the asian and white numbers aren't that far apart. 

Secondly, I don't think the af. american or hispanic numbers are quite as telling. If they're admitted at low levels to begin with, the relative boosting of their applications (and depressing of their scores) could translate to limited effect on asian and white admissions. For instance, those scores might reflect doubling the african american enrollment numbers, but correspond to affecting asian and white applicants by, say, a negative 5%. That's a huge boost for a minimal disadvantage. That's a made up number, but i've done the math for med school applicants before, and the boosting of af americans (i forget by what spread) meant a flat decrease of 5% acceptance for all whites and asians. The negative 5% imposed upon over-represented races paled in comparison to, for instance, raising an applicant's GPA by 0.2. It's important to be able to tease out this data for a more level headed discussion.

Last point: ron unz did an article a long time ago and noted that white anglo saxon protestants (non jew white) enrollment was down similar to asian americans. I hate to possibly find myself in the company of /r/conspiracy members, but i remember the only non-affected group were jews. In other words, WASPs were more disadvantaged than the, ""white,"" label would suggest before disaggregation. I remember the disadvantage not being as severe as for asians. But I haven't read [the article](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/) in a few years. I hope to do so this weekend. I'll correct my comment if when i find out which parts of my memory failed me. 

>The odds of admission for Asians are nearly 30 percent lower than those of their white counterparts.

That's damning. But again, i do wish to see how we do in comparison to WASPs as opposed to a monolith, ""whites."" 

As for the article you posted: it focused too heavily on individual portraits (FOR ME), but i won't lie that they were compelling in their own ways. I would very much like to see a more ron unz styled rebuttal to affirmative action, but that's just my egg headedness.

Nice theory.

If AA's had only 20%, and AA's were in the same category as Whites, then why didn't AA's get more admitted over less qualified white applicants?

Even if you abolished Affirmative Action, what makes you think that they won't just give that 10% to the White applicants?

The thing is, Affirmative Action didn't make the Ivies cap the Asians.  Admitting more African Americans and Latinos doesn't mean they had to Cap Asians.  By pure competition, Asian students should have admitted more than many White applicants.

virtu333,,"Consider MIT.

~30% asian, still has affirmative action (similar URM proportions as the ivies), Northeastern school, very prestigious, etc.

The difference? 97%+ STEM, no legacy preference, D3 athletics. There's your 10% compared to Harvard's 20%

There's a very real issue of homogeneity among Asian applicants that creates artificial competition. We disproportionately apply for STEM, and we pursue similar extracurriculars e.g., from high school youth and all state orchestras to my college orchestra and orchestras at similar elite schools, we made up 2/3 or more of the violin section. Not hard to realize how this happens.

I'd also note that recent classes seem to have seen upticks in proportions of asians, iirc. Duke and Columbia come to mind as two schools with near 30% proportions in recent classes

Berkeley is skewed by Cali's high Asian population. Caltech could be an improvement and is ""purely meritocratic"" but is also impacted by that, and I know a lot of MIT kids who chose it over Caltech because of the environment (only recently has the male female ratio started coming close to being balanced for example).

And what the article misses is that like gender, geography, extracurriculars, etc., is that race is part of diversity as well.

Furthermore, if we care about race at all, then purely socioeconomic affirmative action is *not* a good substitute, by the virtue of simple math. Because racial minorities are general population minorities, the sheer fact that there are more poor white people than minorities (not to be confused with the fact that minorities are more disproportionately poor as a percentage of their individual subpopulation) will mean that more white people will get in as a result of socioeconomic affirmative action."
calf,,"I appreciate your story and speaking out about this, but based on it I think you're making a simple mistake. What you're really talking about in your comment is issues of economic class.

I'd like to clarify with the following:

1. **AA vs Class.** Affirmative action in the US  is not about poverty per se. Originally it was about ""race, creed, color, or national origin"" and of course was extended to other groupings including gender, gender orientation, disability, etc. Less so the discrimination of being from a poor background.

2. **Diversity vs Student quality.** Schools can deal with ethnic diversity, because that has little to do with academic performance. How? Like you said, well-off international African students are coveted because they bring cultural networking capital, *whilst* meeting the intellectual standards set by the schools. Remember that AA decisions are made between students who are equally talented. (For some reason, people tend to forget this, and rationalize instead that an academically worse student gets switched in—a study about Californian residents showed this, and in reality the elite schools will avoid bringing in weak students because that doesn't serve their interest, which is to assemble the cream of the crop.)

3. **Class vs Student quality.** Schools can't deal well with economic class. Your SAT scores are a strong correlator with economic class, that's well known (just google the concept SES). Consequence? If you are from the ""wrong"" class, the school is taking a risk because they're going to get a student who might not perform as well.

Now, I think the above describes a terrible system and status quo. But I also think you unintentionally stir controversy into this by mixing up two issues, and jumping to an invalid conclusion by blaming AA, because the real issue is college institutions not being accountable for class inequity.

If you want economic class inequality to be accommodated somehow, through AA or otherwise, then let's start by being clear about that as the core issue. I'd buy this argument and I'm sure other progressives would, too.

blu_res,,"I agree and I certainly believe racial discrimination has an effect on one's academic development. I was told all throughout my childhood that I must be smart 'cause I'm Asian, I'm gonna go to college 'cause I'm Asian, I get good grades 'cause I'm Asian. Yes, the model minority stereotype is harmful and must be eliminated, but for me and a lot of the Asian students I knew, we kind of believed it, and I think it had a real effect on our performance. It made us confident. It made us willing to study, willing to try, because ""that's just what Asian kids do.""

Nearly all the Asian Americans I knew were automatically put into accelerated learning classes and given the best resources. Pretty much everyone at my high school, from students to teachers to counselors, thought ""The Asian kids are the smart and successful ones.""

Now imagine being black and being told the exact opposite.

edit:
I'd like to add that I'm not trying to erase the experiences of those who did not grow up with the same privileges that I did, particularly those from such overlooked communities as the Hmong and Cambodians, but rather illustrate how the model minority stereotype can, for some Asian Americans such as I and my childhood friends, make us blind to the struggle of those who are more disadvantaged."

But seriously, keeping the AA system as it is is just plain stupid imo. We need bigger educational reform for districts/neighborhoods with crappy schools, we need to reduce young URM males' incarceration rates, etc... AA does little for the root of the issue because it already assumes that you, as a URM, are a student in a position to be considering higher education in the first place. In other words, you're in an environment where you are able to participate in extracurriculars and get a good GPA, form relationships with teachers for recs, write essays, pay for college apps, be able to navigate complicated financial aid stuff like FAFSA, etc. (all of this which is already geared towards kids who grew up in middle class environments or better -- and these kids are not the ones who lack opportunity that AA **should** be geared towards...)"

I think you have a misunderstanding here. AA does not exist to solve racism. It exists to give everyone equal opportunities based on their backgrounds. When you look at the origins of AA, it wasn't created to solve racism but to increase the opportunities (academic and vocational) minorities were receiving. "
GoHiroki,,"That's a great answer. I'm not convinced however. Our sons, daughters, cousins, nieces, and nephews should be penalized for Western mistakes - especially when our ancestors suffered enough for their mistakes (Opium wars, Colonization, Agent Orange dropped on Vietnamese villages, etc) and Western corporations frequently abuse Asian workers in exploitative sweat shops without any consideration for worker safety, age, or the environment. Descriptions of many Asian factories, all done for Western profit, are frequently as horrific as anything depicted in Upton Sinclair's Jungle over 100 years ago. Using the nearly identical arguments for AA in other minorities, Asian minorities should benefit from AA too. "
GoHiroki,,"Well when you're looking at root causes for problems in complex systems, the usual response as detailed by the Toyota method means that you write down everything that could result in a problem. Are the cars bad because of faulty engineering, a culture where juniors can't criticize senior leadership, because of bad marketing etc. A typical response amongst Redditors is ""People suffer because there is bad systematic racism and that is the main/only cause and God made it so."" It's a lazy tautology. 

A comparison can be easily made with East Asian civilizations. Certainly, many of us have suffered under the hands of foreign rule. China suffered immensely under unequal concessions, colonization of Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Opium Wars, the coercion of Coolie labor, the invasions from Japan, the severe loss of life in WW2, etc. One could argue that modern capitalism's agreement with China also produces a large amount of suffering - exploited labor, the laogai system which has half the world's modern slaves and produces trinkets and common goods for Western Markets, 14 hr days 365 days a year with hard manual labor which take tools of labor that has no right to unionize, and all of this performed in a country with weak environmental protection laws (where Western companies can dictate the cost of say textile production without an responsibility for dye leakage into water sources that result in sky rocketing cancer rates). These processes both recent and modern relate to Western markets and their exploitations of vulnerable peoples, but... when Sun Yat Sen, Mao, Deng, and the senior leadership of the Communist party looked at **why our country was failing** they didn't simply point their fingers at the West. 

The difference is that some people like a model that is punitive, retrospective, and finger pointing. Other groups, often more successful, tend to emphasize a continuous effort of improvement that is prospective in nature, constantly analyzes data, encourages a just culture, dissuades a punitive culture, tests new methods to solve old problems, analyzes the results, and focuses on systematic failures with logical methods at addressing them.

The actual purpose of AA is to change the field by engineering the social networks for minority groups and also how they relate to the majority. This can be done in a fair way, by re-biasing towards a minority student who is otherwise academically equal to a majority group student.

Tertiary education is a critical social institution, which is why regulation is needed. AA is supposed to do this through an intergenerational process.

Into a shutdown just on race, as if race wasn't part of the diversity balance here. You also ignore how academic interests/focus, extracurricular activities, and even personality, come into play as part of a diverse campus.

First of all, there's a reason these factors come into play; there are so many damn qualified applicants. Thousand of valedictorians. 200k+ students scoring 2100+ on the SAT. What's a school to do?  Harvard caliber students are everywhere in the other Ivies, and at Duke, UChicago, Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc.

At a certain level, it's about distribution of so many qualified students and these additional factors are in place to create a kind of environment. And because you can't have an orchestra with just violinists (which flows into the homogeneity issue of asian american applicants). And while a lot of elite schools have different flavors, my experience of visiting friends at a many of them and comparing theirs to mine is that they offer fairly similar experiences in the end.

I never said AA should be a lottery system lmao. Where did you get that from?

I thought AA was meant for kids who have lacked the sort of opportunities that make them a traditionally strong college applicant. As it is, the upper class black girl who attends Spence is benefitting much more than the black girl who grew up in an impoverished single parent household not too many streets away. And that's not OK. Neither is holding a lower class Asian student back just because of their race.

As it is, the system is broken as hell. You sound very removed from the college app process as it is today. Right now, AA does allow students with poorer academic performance to attend top colleges. If you could link me to that specific study from earlier, thatd be great but rn I'm very skeptical about such a study being concrete proof of the opposite.

What I'm saying is that if we are to keep AA, how about we actually use it for the kids who have socioeconomic justifications for a shoddier app?"

**But the opportunities have increased.** In 2014, The University of California system admitted more Latino students (29%) than white students (27%). Furthermore, the number of Hispanics enrolled in college tripled over the past decade and for the first time in 2012, their college enrollment rate was higher than that of Whites (49% compared to 47%). Additionally, colleges are admitting and enrolling more Blacks than before (up 9% to 14%). African American students are on pace to meet the number of white students that attend college directly after graduating high school (66% for Blacks, 70% for Whites).

AA was created increase the educational opportunities of minorities in the 60s. That problem doesn't exist to the magnitude it used to as evidenced by all the statistics I provided. That just shows how outdated AA is."

> First of all, there's a reason these factors come into play; there are so many damn qualified applicants. Thousand of valedictorians. 200k+ students scoring 2100+ on the SAT. 

And this is my point, the minorities coming to top tier schools through AA are not as qualified as rest of the applicants. Sure, the lower qualifications are understandable if that applicant came from a rougher background, the state of AA today doesn't take that into account. It doesn't ask about your circumstances or you income level. Instead, it groups you into the unfair assumption that if you're a minority, you come from rough background and if you're not, you've had an easy life.

The people currently benefiting from AA are well off minorities who have lower qualifications but still get into top colleges, and that's just the reality of it.

I also know an asian american student (personal friend) who had a pretty underwhelming app but was president of the class and of other government clubs, and is at Harvard.

Two of your anecdotal experiences don't make up for the thousands of qualified Asians that don't get accepted. 

Yes perhaps Princeton took that one Asian's student's case into account, but by no means is this a general trend or the norm. The difference this, this specific applicant more than likely had to explain his background and circumstances through one of this essays (when he could have potentially written about something else) whereas a minority would have received the same treatment by merely filling in a bubble, regardless of whether the student was really impoverished or not.  How is it fair that black applicant whose family makes $100,000/yr is given the same preferential treatment as another black applicant whose family makes $20,000 year?

Michael Wang is a small piece of a bigger pie that Asian students face across the country. An Asian applicant with a 2350 SAT is considered at equal to Black applicant with a 1900. I don't know how you can sit there and tell me that asians are treated the same way as black applicants, because honestly that's just ridiculous.

America may become minority-majority country soon, but 60% of college admissions is reasonable considering whites are 50% of the population. You can't argue against that, and then turn around and argue that people shouldn't look into Asian acceptance rates of 20% despite being 5% of the population. 

To me, the question of AA is very simple. It's a brutal moral choice. 

Do we Asian Americans choose to sacrifice, even if unfairly, to promote a more diverse and less racially stratified America.

Or do we look after our own, and shoot for an America that's majority White and Asian in the elite universities, and eventually centers of power and wealth. Effectively shutting out blacks and latinos. 

Don't dance around the issue. Don't do the ""Gee, it's not a zero-sum game"" BS. Look at Harvard, as it is, with its soft quota, and look at Stuyversant that's 90% Asian and a dozen black and latinos kids.

TheBigBoss777,,"These are the moments when I get told to ""check my privilege"" after offering my opinion on the matter (as if being Asian-American bears any racial privilege to begin with).

But let's be honest here: Affirmative Action, as it's constructed today, negatively affects Asian-Americans and we shouldn't be told to ""check our privilege"" when we say it does.

Granted, Asian-Americans are more likely to live in some kind of financial comfort when compared to African-Americans or Latinx-Americans. But it doesn't change the fact that Asian-Americans are often imposed with higher expectations or examined with greater scrutiny during the admissions process, even more so than white applicants. And the conversation doesn't even begin to include that one impoverished Southeast Asian teenager who has to jump through the same hurtles on top of trying to rise above the struggles of poverty and crime.

Rather than making Affirmative Action a game of color, why not make it a system of prioritizing needs? Overall, to me, the Affirmative Action debate seems to be a distraction from the issues that would actually help disadvantaged people of color, whether they're black, Latinx, Asian, etc. I seriously wonder why there isn't more discussion on improving K-12 education for disadvantaged children or a bigger emphasis on fighting poverty.

,,"I'm just annoyed at how there's so much handwaving about the consequences of both pro-AA and anti-AA.

The pro side is like ""It's not a 0 sum game"" except it is, especially at the top universities and schools.

The anti-side is like ""It's not about punishing latinos and blacks"". Except even the best case scenerios as seen by reality, Asians displace everyone including and especially blacks and latinos.

I wish everyone would be honest and just declare their values. The wishy-washy ""But on the other hand"" type articles like this are just meant for people to feel good. They don't address the core of the issue at all."
rentonwong,Support Asian-American Media!,"The current system as it stands preserves while privilege while playing off one minority group against another. The fact that most of these so-called Asian-American groups support the current system for the sake of social justice is weird given that social justice is meant to result in an environment where all are equal. 

It's even more ironic when there is growing evidence that Affirmative Action actually harms Asian-Americans despite many supporting it.  Social Justice does not involve a situation where Asian-Americans have to collectively hold themselves back or screw themselves for the sake of pleasing everyone else."
